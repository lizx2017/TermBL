texts:Reorganize SVN
The SVN directory structure needs to be reorganized to move the Website sources out from under the uimaj project.  On the dev list the consensus seems to be that we should have top level "site" and "uimaj" directories (leaving room to add "uimacpp", "sandbox", etc. later).  So the structure should look something like:site/  trunk/    uima-website/    xml sources and generated html files go here  uimaj/  trunk/    uima-docbooks/    documentation is here    uimaj-xxxx/  code is here

texts:Split JCas into interface and implementation
We should split the existing JCAS class into an interface org.apache.uima.jcas.JCas and its implementation org.apache.uima.jcas.impl.JCasImpl.  This follows good design practices and also is consistent with the rest of uimaj-core.  It is important to do this prior to our first release since it will be a non-compatible change for user code.

texts:Problem scaling out CAS multipliers
In order to avoid over filling request queues, all components in UIMA-AS that can generate new CASes to put into play are limited to a user definable value. CAS multipliers are limited by the size of their private casPool; when that is used up they must wait for CASes to be freed before creating new ones.Similarly, a remote CAS multiplier can generate and return as many new CASes as are defined for it's local CM casPool. At that point, it must wait for "free CAS" messages coming from it's client before sending more. Each remote CM uses a "free CAS queue" to receive these messages.Currently, all instances of a remote CM use the same free CAS queue. This must be changed so that every remote CM defines a unique free CAS queue.

Also - remove unused dependency on "sister-project" for uima-as-docbook - the sister project being uima-docbook  (because it isn't used).  This change allows the build/assembly operation of uima-as to not require uima-docbook.

texts:uima-as release process not capturing a known level of core uima
The current uima-as release process does not tag a level of the core uima used to supply its lib/jars; it uses whatever is in the builder's local  maven repository, which may be in some unknown state.  Attaching the right source to these jars is difficult, if not impossible (impossible if there were local uncommitted changes in the builder's system, that were used to build the local repo, but never checked in.)The release process needs to tag the version of core uima that uima-as is based on, and extract that and build it before building uima-as.The source distribution for uima-as should include a pointer to the tag in svn (the source distr for core uima is large mainly due to documentation, doc tooling, and tests).

texts:ConceptMapper--a highly configurable, token-based dictionary lookup UIMA component
ConceptMapper is a token-based dictionary lookup UIMA component. It wasdesigned specifically to allow any external tokenizer that is a UIMAcomponent to be used to tokenize its dictionary. Using the same tokenizeron both the dictionary and for subsequent text processing preventssituations where a particular dictionary entry is not found, though itexists, because it was tokenized differently than the text being processed.ConceptMapper is highly configurable, in terms of: the way dictionary entries are mapped to resultant annotations the way input documents are processed the availability of multiple lookup strategies its various output options.Additionally, a set of post-processing filters are supplied, as well as aninterface to easily create new filters. This allows for overgeneratingresults during the lookup phase, if so desired, then reducing the resultset according to particular rules.More details:The structure of the dictionary itself is quite flexible. Entries can haveany number of variants (synonyms), and arbitrary features can be associatedwith dictionary entries. Individual variants inherit features from parenttoken (i.e., the canonical from), but can override them or add additionalfeatures. In the following sample dictionary entry, there are 5 variants ofthe canonical form, and as described earlier, each inherits the SemClassand POS attributes from the canonical form, with the exception of thevariant "mesenteric fibromatosis (c48.1)", which overrides the value of theSemClass attribute (this is somewhat of a contrived example, just to makethat point):<token canonical="abdominal fibromatosis" SemClass="Diagnosis" POS="NN">   <variant base="abdominal fibromatosis" />   <variant base="abdominal desmoid" />   <variant base="mesenteric fibromatosis (c48.1)"SemClass="Diagnosis-Site" />   <variant base="mesenteric fibromatosis" />   <variant base="retroperitoneal fibromatosis" /></token>Input tokens are processed one span at a time, where both the token andspan (usually a sentence) annotation type are configurable. Additionally,the particular feature of the token annotation to use for lookups can bespecified, otherwise its covered text is used. Other input configurationsettings are whether to use case sensitive matching, an optional class nameof a stemmer to apply to the tokens, and a list of stop words to to ignoreduring lookup. One additional input control mechanism is the ability toskip tokens during lookups based on particular feature values. In this way,it is easy to skip, for example, all tokens with particular part of speechtags, or with some previously computed semantic class.Output is in the form of new annotations, and the type of resultingannotations can be specified in a descriptor file. The mapping fromdictionary entry attributes to the result annotation features can also bespecified. Additionally, a string containing the matched text, a list ofmatched tokens, and the span enclosing the match can be specified to be setin the result annotations. It is also possible to indicate dictionaryattributes to write back into each of the matched tokens.Dictionary lookup is controlled by three parameters in the descriptor, oneof which allows for order-independent lookup (i.e., A B == B A), anothertogles between finding only the longest match vs. finding all possiblematches. The final parameter specifies the search strategy, of which thereare three. The default search strategy only considers contiguous tokens(not including tokens frm the stop word list or otherwise skipped tokens),and then begins the subsequent search after the longest match. The secondstrategy allows for ignoring non-matching tokens, allowing for disjointmatches, so that a dictionary entry of    A Cwould match against the text    A B CAs with the default search strategy, the subsequent search begins after thelongest match. The final search strategy is identical to the previous,except that subsequent searches begin one token ahead, instead of after theprevious match. This enables overlapped matching.

texts:Modify dd2spring to handle UIMA-AS Aggregate Cas Multipliers
dd2spring determines if a component is a Cas Multiplier by checking the component's descriptor outputsNewCASes property. If the component is a CM, the dd2spring generates spring xml artifacts to create a special cas pool to be used to create new CASes. For a Primitive CM, this is necessary. As the Primitive CM actually creates new CASes from an input CAS it needs the special cas pool. If the CM is an Aggregate, this special cas pool is not necessary. The aggregate CM outputs new CASes, but it doesnt create them. It uses a shadow CAS Pool (one per remote CM delegate) to deserialize CASes instead. The current dd2spring code generates a warning when parsing a deployment descriptor containing an aggregate CM:         WARN: line-number: 34 deployment descriptor for analysisEngine: <key>Queue is for a CAS Multiplier (or Collection Reader wrapped as a CAS Multiplier).  However, the <casMultiplier> element is missing. Defaulting to a poolSize of 1 for this case.

texts:Remove char heap/ref heap in StringHeap of the CAS
The StringHeap class provides two ways to store strings: either as Java strings, or by copying characters onto a character heap.  The second option is only used for deserialization from a binary CAS.  However, even if not used, this capability means a very significant memory overhead.  To demonstrate this, I ran the following experiment.  As analysis engine, I used our sandbox POS tagger.  It sets just one string feature on each token.  As text, I used a 2.4MB input file (2x moby.txt).  To run this in IBM Java 1.5.0_7 (which happens to be the JVM I'm interested in) you need to specify -Xmx135M.  I checked 5MB increments.  The I patched the StringHeap implementation to work without the additional book keeping overhead and ran the experiment again.  I was then able to run with -Xmx115M.  This represents a very significant gain, particularly given the fact that I ran so little analysis (only tokens and sentences are produced, and only a single string-valued feature set).  The new code also ran a tiny bit faster, but not much.  One might see more improvement for analysis that is not as compute intensive as the Tagger.The challenge is to make sure that the serialization code still works after this change.

texts:Use of the JCas cache should be configurable
The JCas caches all CAS objects that are accessed through it.  This means that JCas objects that are no longer used can't be garbage collected.  If only part of the processing chain uses the JCas, or the caching is redundant for some other reason, this produces a severe memory overhead.I ran the same experiment I ran for UIMA-1067: doubled the size of Moby Dick and ran the POS tagger from the sandbox.  I used the improved version from UIMA-1067 as base case and simply commented out the line that adds JCas objects to the cache.  This reduced the required heap size from 115MB to 105MB.  It also improved the performance from around 10s for the base case to consistently under 9s for the version without any caching.  I looked at the tagger source code, and saw that it keeps its own list of tokens around.  So the savings are just the caching data structure.There may be cases where the JCas cache is a performance win, though I'd be curious to see the benchmarks.  So we should not just turn it off, but make it configurable.

texts:The default setting of prefetch=1 is causing problems
The new JMX monitor occasionally shows idle times of many seconds for a scaled out remote delegate that is getting many CASes per second. Assuming the monitor is correct, the problem is that AMQ is not evenly distributing the work to all the service instances. Other recent experiences have demonstrated that uneven distribution is solved with prefetch=0. While there is some possibility that prefetch > 0 may be useful in some situations for remote delegates, for colocated delegates there is little doubt that a prefetch greater than 0 cannot help performance and can only screw up load balancing.prefetch=0 should be the default everywhere.

texts:Calling jcas.getType for a type that is not defined in the descriptor causes a lot of object allocation
This is related to UIMA-738.  if you attempt to call jcas.getType() for a type that's not defined in the type system, the JCas responds by going through the type system and re-creating all of the _Type objects for all known types.  For large type systems, this causes some unnecessary work and creates lots of temporary objects that need to be collected.The situation used to be worse.  Under UIMA-738 we fixed problems that caused the JCas to become unstable after this operation.  Now at least it doesn't break anything, but there is this performance issue.To check this, you can run the existing method in JCasTests:  public void testUndefinedType() throws Exception {    //create jcas with no type system    JCas jcas = CasCreationUtils.createCas(new TypeSystemDescription_impl(), null, null).getJCas();    jcas.setDocumentText("This is a test.");    try {      //this should throw an exception      jcas.getType(Sentence.type);      fail();     } catch(CASRuntimeException e) {    }    //check that this does not leave JCAS in an inconsistent state    //(a check for bug UIMA-738)    Iterator iter = jcas.getAnnotationIndex().iterator();    assertTrue(iter.hasNext());    Annotation annot = (Annotation)iter.next();    assertEquals("This is a test.", annot.getCoveredText());  }The call to jcas.getType(Sentence.type) will cause all known _Type objects to be instantiated (in this case, the builtins).  This can be seen from stepping into this method in the debugger, or from putting a breakpoint in the TOP_Type constructor.

texts:UIMA AS use of TimeToLive can lead to service request failures.
One common scenario is that a service crashes while processing a processCas request, and additional requests are left in the service request queue. UIMA AS allows timeout values to be set for service requests so that if a reply not received within the timeout period, an error is generated on the client and appropriate actions taken.What happens to the queued service requests? If the service is restarted, it will attempt to process them and reply to the originating client. If a client receives a reply to a request that had timeout out, it will log and ignore it. If the client has gone away, the service will log and ignore the error when trying to reply. However, some requests may be expensive to process and it is desirable to avoid this work. Other requests may contain stale content that will cause problems for the new service to process.In order to avoid these problems, when a timeout value is specified UIMA AS sets TimeToLive to the timeout period. A TimeToLive setting allows the JMS system to dispose of requests that cannot be delivered in time, normally transferring them to a "dead letter queue". AMQ 5.0 fully supports this mechanism, but given some blocking issues with AMQ 5.0, UIMA AS had to revert back to v4.1.1 for the first release.Up until recently our experience was that TimeToLive was ignored in AMQ 4.1.1, but this is not the case. With a AMQ C++ consumer, expired messages will be removed from the queue and thrown away. With a 4.1.1 Java consumer running under some JRE versions (e.g. Sun 1.6_02 on Linux), expired messages will be ignored and left in the queue. If this is not confusing enough, there is the AMQ definition of TimeToLive: it is based on the absolute time the message was created. Any clock skew between the producer and consumer machines will not be accounted for. For example, if a UIMA AS client is running on a machine whose clock is more than 60 seconds behind the machine running the UIMA AS service, a message request with a timeout of 60 seconds or less will expire before it is sent.In the future UIMA AS may implement an option to not use TimeToLive at all. The workaround for now is to make sure the clocks on all client and service machines are synchronized.

It should be possible (if unusual) to send a CAS to the same queue from different stages in its flow.  Or at least to a queue with the same name on a different broker.  Alternatively if we insist that aggregates must have unique queue names then we should enforce it.

This is especially true for aggregates which do little processing and spent most time de-serializing and serializing CASes. The synchronization needs only be applied while merging secondary CASes. In all other cases, synchronization around deserialization should not be used.

texts:Timeout needs different implementation to eliminate interaction with CAS pool size
When a timeout value is specified for process calls, a timer is set for each processCas request. If an aggregate controller (or client API) sends multiple process requests to the same service, the timeout must be increased to account for the potential processing delay of the earlier requests. Currently the timeout value is static, specified in the deployment descriptor; if a user changes the CAS pools size, they may have to change the timeout to compensate.A better design would decouple these things by changing the implementation of timeout. For example, the timeout value could be dynamic, taking into account the number of outstanding requests sent by the same client. The new implementation should take into account the need to set appropriate time-to-live values for the request messages.

This notification enables the CM to release the next CAS and send another to a client. Scaleout of Remote CM is also supported now.and Added support for Aggregate CAS Multipliers. Based on OperationalProperties an Aggregate UIMA-As may output CASes to its client. The Aggregate CM creates a special temp queue for receiving Free CAS requests from a client.dd2spring.xsl needs updating to align with this new approach; there are beans it generates which are no longer used.

See http://incubator.apache.org/uima/downloads/releaseDocs/2.2.2-incubating/docs/html/tutorials_and_users_guides/tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae.contract_for_annotator_methodsThis is intended to make writing UIMA components by our user community easier, and to eliminate many hard-to-diagnose issues that could occur otherwise.The FlowController main object class, the one that is specified in the custom flow control specification for an aggregate, in UIMA-AS, can be (we think, but to be investigated  ) be called on multiple threads at the same time, in the current implementation.  This Jira is to fix this, by synchronizing on the flow controller object so that users don't have to write thread safe implementations of this class.Also, the docs in the above referenced manual should be updated to include the flow controller object in the set of objects where the framework guarantees that instances of this object will not be called on multiple threads at the same time.

texts:The TCAS class should be dropped
The introduction of multiples views per CAS was initially implemented using the CAS interface for the base CAS and the TCAS interface for all views. Process method signatures for both TCAS and CAS were proprogated, and the result was a complicated situation for users.In v2 the entire TextAnalysisEngine interface is deprecated. The TCAS no longer serves a useful purpose. Since Apache UIMA requires some source code changes, now is a good time to eliminate the TCAS. Migration for almost all user code would be to replace TCAS with CAS and getTCAS() with getView(). This change has already been applied to the upcoming uima C++ code.

Both the trunk code (before the merge) and the merged code (from the branch) seem to exhibit this problem although on different tests. The code from the trunk (before the merge) hangs on testcase: testTerminateOnFlowControllerException, while the merged code hangs on testAggregateProcessCallWithLongDelay.

texts:Always deliver the base CAS to the process method
Currently there is a distinction made for "single view" and "multiple view" components. The UIMA architecture standard proposes that all components are multiple view components and be delivered a handle to the base CAS, and the component retrieves views as required. The change to existing "single view" component would be to add one line of code in the process method: cas = passInCas.getView(), which would return the View currently given to these components as determined by Sofa mapping.

texts:UIMA-AS inputQueueScaleout should be settable on nested co-located aggregates
My initial thinking about this reasoned that for co-located nested aggregates, their input queues would not need any scaleout because there would be no deserialization (the input queue passes a handle instead of a serialized CAS for co-located nested aggregates).  And also, no re-serialization back to the invoker (again, just a handle is passed).However, Eddie has pointed out that if the nested aggregate has a remote delegate as its first component, then the serialization work going to that delegate is done using the thread on the input queue listener.  Also, I note that if the flow controller work requires any significant time, scaleout might be needed, as the input queue listener thread is used for the first entry into the flow controller (subsequent entries into the flow controller run on the aggregate's reply queue listeners).Because of this, we should allow the inputQueueScaleout parameter on nested aggregates, as well as just on the top level one.

Our project reuses a common type system that we got from a different source.  The common type system descriptor is imported into our main type system descriptor.  The common type system has its own JCas types, in a jar file.  When we generate JCas types for our main type system descriptor, it currently generates all of the classes for all of the imported type systems as well.  We don't want this behavior, so we have to manually go through and delete those classes.I think JCasGen should only generate types for the type system descriptor that you run it on, not on imported type system descriptors.

texts:visual cue for selected annotation
It is often hard to tell which annotation is selected.  For example, when you click on an annotation in the outline, nothing changes in the text pane.  This can be very disorienting if you have many annotations of the same type close together.  Some visual cue would be very helpful.  The default behavior in knowtator is to draw black lines above and below the span of the selected annotation.  Another provided option is to fade out all of the other annotations leaving only the selected annotation a bright color.  (I like the former better).  Additionally, it would be nice if the annotations related via type features to the selected annotation could be visualized in the text pane.  Knowtator does this by drawing dashed lines above and below the annotations that are related to the selected annotation.

texts:filling in a type feature of type FSArray seems broken
I can't seem to add values to type features of type FSArray.  When I click the + icon in the Edit View I get a dialog that asks me to enter the size of the array.  I enter e.g. 2 and the dialog goes away but nothing happens except that entries are added to the Error Log.  The message says "Unhandled event loop exception" and the trace is included below.Knowtator provides three different ways to fill in one annotation as a feature value of another.  1)  select an annotation that has the feature to be filled in and then click on the annotation that will be the feature value.  A context menu will appear that provides an option to fill in the feature of the selected annotation with the annotation just clicked on.  2) Clicking on a + icon by the feature of the selected annotation brings up a dialog containing the annotations that can be used to satisfy the feature as consistent with the type system.  3) selecting a span of text and then clicking on a create icon by the feature of the selected annotation will create an annotation appropriate for the feature and fill it in with the newly created feature.  org.apache.uima.caseditor.core.TaeError: Unkown array type!at org.apache.uima.caseditor.editor.editview.EditViewPage$CreateFeatureStructrueValue.createFS(Unknown Source)at org.apache.uima.caseditor.editor.editview.EditViewPage$CreateFeatureStructrueValue.run(Unknown Source)at org.eclipse.ui.actions.BaseSelectionListenerAction.runWithEvent(BaseSelectionListenerAction.java:168)at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.handleWidgetSelection(ActionContributionItem.java:546)at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.access$2(ActionContributionItem.java:490)at org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem$6.handleEvent(ActionContributionItem.java:443)at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.EventTable.sendEvent(EventTable.java:66)at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.sendEvent(Widget.java:938)at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runDeferredEvents(Display.java:3682)at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java:3293)at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.runEventLoop(Workbench.java:2389)at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.runUI(Workbench.java:2353)at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.access$4(Workbench.java:2219)at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench$4.run(Workbench.java:466)at org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.Realm.runWithDefault(Realm.java:289)at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench(Workbench.java:461)at org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(PlatformUI.java:149)at org.apache.uima.caseditor.Application.start(Unknown Source)at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.app.EclipseAppHandle.run(EclipseAppHandle.java:169)at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.runApplication(EclipseAppLauncher.java:106)at org.eclipse.core.runtime.internal.adaptor.EclipseAppLauncher.start(EclipseAppLauncher.java:76)at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:363)at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:176)at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:508)at org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:447)

When you click on a node in the tree it provides you a context sensitive menu that gives you an option to create a new annotation for the currently highlighted text (if any) followed by options for selecting the annotations of that type (one menu item per annotation).

UIMA AS client framework code caches a CAS before sending (async) request to UIMA AS service. When the reply is received the CAS is retrieved from the cache, the client (user) code is called via a listener and the CAS is subsequently released.  For synchronous calls the user code is responsible for each CAS release. When a reply containing an exception is received (for both sync and async send), the exception handler notifies the user code but never releases the CAS. This may lead to hangs and may impact performance since some CASes are never released.

In complex deployments involving colocated, multi-level aggregates CAS states changed by one aggregate cause problems in other aggregates. Particularly when making decisions when to release a CAS. In such deployments hangs may occur. Add a private (non-shared) cache to each UIMA AS controller where the state of each CAS is kept. CAS instance should be kept in the global InProcessCache that is shared by all colocated UIMA AS services.

texts:When parsing an aggregate descriptor, should parse a shared type system file only once
Frequently an aggregate will contain several primitives that all import a single shared type system descriptor.  Currently, the shared type system descriptor will be separately parsed for each of the primitives, and each primitive descriptor will contain a separate copy of the TypeSystemDescription object.When there are a large number of primitives and a large number of types in the shared type system, this parsing takes a long time and the resulting TypeSystemDescription objects consume a lot of memory.Instead, we could keep a cache of imports that have already been parsed, and we can reuse the same TypeSystemDescription object within each of the primitive descriptors rather than having a separate copy.

Arron Kaplan raised the question of when parent CASes are processed relative to their children. See http://markmail.org/message/5cop7iv2nshouhgs  As of now, the processing order for a multi-threaded UIMA AS aggregate is different than that for a single-threaded UIMA aggregate.A discussion with Burn, Adam, Jerry, Marshall and myself concluded that the default processing order for UIMA AS should be changed to be the same as in UIMA, in order to have the same application behavior for both. This will be done by suspending flow of a parent CAS after it is returned from a CasMultiplier delegate until all its children CASes have finished processing.However, there also needs to be a UIMA AS deployment option for CasMultiplier delegates that allows the parent CAS to resume processing immediately after being returned from the CM. This option is needed to enable parallel processing.

texts:Error handling for CASes generated in an aggregate needs clarification.
Burn raised the question of error handling for CM children within a multi-threaded UIMA AS aggregate. A summary of discussion with Burn, Adam, Jerry, Marshall and Eddie is below.A child CAS is a CAS that was generated by a CasMultiplier delegate within the same aggregate. The child's parent CAS will never be returned by an aggregate until all processing of it's children is completed.A child CAS may encounter an error condition while being processed by a delegate. If the delegate error handling results in a non-recoverable error, processing of the child's parent CAS will be stopped and the error report will be returned against that parent CAS. If the parent CAS is itself a child CAS, the error will be propagated to its parent CAS.Note:The parent CAS(es) may have other outstanding children in play (currently being processed). Our discussion touched on but did not fully analyze whether processing on these children should continue or be stopped. More discussion needed.

texts:CasManager_impl logic for lazy merge of the type system could lead to excessive work or missed errors
The CasManager_impl class is sometimes (mostly?) (but not always) used when assembling a pipeline of UIMA components.  There is one instance of this associated with each Resource Manager instance.  (PearWrapper versions of the ResourceManager share this component).It has 2 phases.  At "initialization", its method addMetaData is repeatedly called as a part of the initialization phase of components being assembled to run under one ResourceManager instance, to collect all the metadata from the components (e.g., their individual type systems, type priorities, and index definitions).At the first call that requires the merged result, e.g. getCasDefinition(), the class merges all the collected metadata and uses it to produce the CAS's type system, indexes, etc.  After this first call, additional calls to addMetaData which attempt to add new things not already in the merge, should result in an error.  In the current implementation, the call to addMetaData in this case not only won't result in any error, but it will reset the class instance, so that a subsequent call to get the CAS definition will result in merging being again called, and a new, non-identical merged result will be returned.  This could result in CASes in a pool, for instance, having different type systems.Normally, this sequence will never happen; however, in the multi-threaded case, where initialization and processing could occur at the same time across multiple instances, it could happen that addMetaData could be called by a thread still initializing, while another thread has already obtained the "final" merged CAS definition.  In these cases, the addMetaData call could be "ignored", but in the general case, one would need to check to see if the metaData being added would change the existing type system, and throw an error if it did.

We also have a "flat" layout for subprojects, following Eclipse conventions.  When running maven on a component, say, uimaj-ep-configurator, its POM has a parent POM.  This parent is "looked up" using the maven system of identifying artifacts, in the maven repository chain, starting with the local repository.  This means that if you change any of the super POMs in the chain, those changes are ignored until you do a "mvn install" on those POMs.  The work-around was to do a "mvn -N install" in the directory where the changed POM was.  The -N flag says just do the install on the POM, and skip any sub-processing of the aggregated "modules" (if any) that the POM specified using the <modules> element.Recently, while trying to improve the maven builds, I (again) forgot this fact, and wondered why my changes to the superPom were not having any effect.  To overcome this (for future maintainers so they won't suffer from this), add an optional <relativePath> element to the <parent> element of all the POMs in the uimaj and uimaj-as projects.  (Perhaps this should also be done, at some point, for the other projects too, but that can be another Jira).The <relativePath> is a relative path to the directory containing the parent POM, and will be tried first before looking up the POM in the repositories.

This is undocumented, and most unexpected.I chatted with Michael about this.  He thinks it may be because the same code that creates the classpath in the pear packager is used in the runtime.  The packager does collect all jar files it can find and puts them in the classpath, and the pear file.  That's fine for the packager, but not the runtime.  We should either have an explicit classpath, or use all jar files in the lib dir, but not both.

texts:Need a Better Approach For Specifying UIMA AS Broker URL in Deployment Descriptor
Each UIMA AS deployment descriptor requires at least one Broker URL for the connection factory. Instead of hard coding the URL, perhaps a placeholder for it should be used. At runtime, the placeholder could be resolved to the actual URL by Spring resolver component. The value could come from either an external file or from an environment. The new approach should accommodate specifying more than one placeholder, since an aggregate may have delegates whose queues are managed by a different broker. The new approach would simplify deployment of UIMA AS services, especially during testing.A placeholder syntax could be inherited from Spring, where it looks like ${placeholder-name}. dd2spring would need to change to handle a placeholder notation in addition to supporting hard coded broker URL that we use now. A new bean must be added to the generated xml. It will be :<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">    <property name="systemPropertiesModeName"  value="SYSTEM_PROPERTIES_MODE_OVERRIDE"/>   </bean>This bean is setup to resolve placeholders using system variables, like -Dplaceholder-name=placeholder-value

texts:PerformanceReports for PEAR not being generated in a CPE
When an installed PEAR is included as an AE in a Collection Processing Engine, the performance report generated by the CPE doesn't include any figures for the PEAR. The only work-around is to install the pear and then reference the AE descriptor directly, however this ruins the entire point of using the PEAR - it automatically sets the classpath, datapath etc for you. I discussed this issue with Thilo Goetz, who said I should raise a bug against it. Please see correspondence below about this issue with Thilo.My Message:Hi Thilo,I work for the LanguageWare team in Dublin, and am having an issue getting performance numbers for PEARs used in a Collection Processing Engine. Essentially, when you refer to the PEAR using the pearSpecifier file, then the performance of the PEAR is not included in the Performance Report. However, if you run the PEAR by referring to its main descriptor directly (and setting up the classpath etc manually) you will correctly get the performance of the components in the PEAR included in the performance report.Am I doing something wrong, or is there a way to work around this? For example, is this just an issue when using PEARs in a CPE, or can I get the information some other way? I'm trying to set up an automated process for testing the performance of a PEAR against a corpus, and would like to avoid having to write code / scripts for thisHis Responses:Hi Kevin,that issue somehow seems familiar.  I've looked into those PerformanceReports because of another bug I found, and I think I noticed this, too (http://www.mail-archive.com/uima-dev%40incubator.apache.org/msg06565.html).  So I think this is a UIMA issue, due to the special nature of pear descriptors (they are not regular AE descriptors).  So the only workaround I can think of at this time is to not use pears, or install the pear and then reference the AE descriptor directly, if that's possible.Related PostsI found this post http://markmail.org/message/doknwh5iecuhtai3 that seems to refer to the exact same issue

But the "waitTimeBetweenRetries" delay is not used at all.Apparently in the implementation of method:           private int attachToServices(boolean redeploy, String aServiceUri, int howMany,                  ProcessingContainer aProcessingContainer) throws Exception;of the class org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.container.deployer.vinci.VinciCasProcessorDeployerthe "sleepBetweenRetries" only occurs if the Vinci Cas processor is in "exclusive" mode.On the contrary (random mode) the method calls directly the method          private synchronized booleanactivateProcessor(CasProcessorConfiguration aCasProcessorConfig,                  String aService, ProcessingContainer aProcessingContainer, boolean redeploy);         Which uses a hard coded timeout of 1 sec (SLEEP_TIME) between each retries instead of the waitTimeBetweenRetries.The bug has been confirmed by Jerry Cwiklik and he proposed the attached patch which solves the problem

texts:Fix Uima AS Client memory leak
While running testcases in debug mode in eclipse there is evidence of a memory leak. One of the threads in the Uima AS client is not terminating when the testcase stops. It looks like a thread in BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngineCommon_impl.serveCASes() is not stopping. This thread is reading an internal queue containing CASes destined for the remote service. It blocks in the take() method of the queue and thus causing a leak.

texts:Add OSGI support to uima-as
UIMA AS should support running in an OSGI container.To achieve this an uimaj-as-ep-runtime plugin is added to the uima-asproject which creates an osgi bundle which wraps all uima-as jar files,like it is done for the uimaj-ep-runtime plugin.

texts:Fix a hang in the Uima AS client
When running Uima AS testDeployAgainAndAgain() testcase found a bug that causes a hang. When a client completes the first run it doesnt reset a casQueueProducerReady boolean flag in the stop() method. Subsequent run causes the client API to hang since the CAS producing thread is not started due to the casQueueProducerReady  flag not being reset.

Discovered working with UIMA AS, and subsequently found not to be working with core UIMA either.Based on offline discussion between Jerry and Adam, the suggested fix was to the FC wrapper:"The FlowControllerContainer wrapper around the FlowController object does not expose collectionProcessComplete() method. Add a new method and delegate collectionProcessComplete to FlowController instance."

texts:Modify UIMA AS Endpoint Object To Use Volatile Booleans
Endpoint object in Uima AS should declare booleans as volatile to avoid possible race conditions. Due to java memory model, an unsychronized change of a boolean value in one thread may not be visible to another thread. Declaring a boolean as volatile fixes this without requiring explicit synchronization.

texts:Provide better support for filenames with spaces in resource URL
The UimaContext.getResourceURL() method is difficult to use correctly.  It is tempting for users to write code such as: URL url = getContext().getResourceURL(key); FileReader fr = new FileReader(url.getPath());which is not safe since the URL can contain spaces encoded as %20, and the url.getPath() does not automatically decode them.We should add the alternative methods and appropriate JavaDoc comments guiding the user toward the appropriate method:URI getResourceURI() &#8211; this works better because URI.getPath() does do decoding.String getResourceFilePath() &#8211; if the URL is a "file:" URL, return its decoded path, otherwise throw an exception (e.g., for an "http" URL)Additionally, it would be nice if we supported filenames (without the file: prefix) in the <fileUrl> descriptor element, for example:<fileUrl>c:/program files/myproj/myfile.txt</fileUrl>Currently this gives a MalformedUrlException, but it would be helpful for the framework to detect that exception and try appending "file:/" to see if that makes a valid URL.

texts:Extend CasCopier to support multiple views
The CasCopier utility class should support multiple views/Sofas.1) There should be a way to copy multiple views in the source CAS, each to its own view in the target CAS, while keeping a "memory" of copied FS so duplicates are not created.2) References to Sofas need to be preserved in the target CAS.  If we copy a source FS referencing a Sofa with SofaID "Foo" then this should result in a reference to the Sofa with the same SofaID in the target CAS.  If that Sofa does not exist, we can either create it or throw an exception (probably this should be determined by an agument to the method call).

texts:PearAnalysisEngineWrapper does not expose Management Interface of the wrapped AE
Through the PEAR API it is possible to create an AE which do not provide any details of its operation through the Management Interface. The reason is that the created PearAnalysisEngineWrapper object does not expose the Management Interface from the wrapped AE. A client can only read the never updated performance stats of the PearAnalysisEngineWrapper object.

texts:Use @Deprecated annotation also
Currently only the @deprecated javadoc tag is used to indicate deprecation, but it is not guaranteed to issue a compiler warning in client code, though the sun java compiler does it. To fix it we can just add the @Deprecate annotation additional which is specified to issue a compiler warning and is supported since java 1.5.I suggest that we use the eclipse code clean up tool to do it once for all code in our repository.For further information see:http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javadoc/deprecation/deprecation.html

When a delegate in a parallel step fails the number of replies received is incremented twice, so the reply from the last delegate is not merged into the CAS.  When it is received it will reenter the flow if the CAS is still active, causing even more trouble.I have a test case that demonstrates the problem.Also we should make the check for all-replies-received atomic so that only one reply- or error-processing thread will send the CAS on to the next step, or, depending on the error-handling, discard the CAS or terminate the service.

texts:Exceptions on generated CASes are returned to client without parentage information
The client should be told which of its input CASes might have (indirectly) generated this failing CAS.  Also is there any value in sending more than one exception if many children fail?  If the aggregate is not a CM then the client should just be told that the input CAS failed.Here is part of a recent email discussion on this problem:I think I have a somewhat clearer picture of how we might handle errors on child CASes.  First consider Primitive & Aggregate CMs, and then a non-CM aggregate that contains a CM. I can see 3 different ways an application may wish to handle errors on child CASes:Primitive CM Stop generating children/descendants of the input CAS and return an exception on the input CASGenerate an "incomplete" CAS &#8211; perhaps marked as "damaged"(useful when the total count must be preserved and a place-holder provided)Ignore the error, generate no CAS and carry on to generate the next CAS (if any)Aggregate CMStop generating any more children/descendants from the input CAS and return the exception on the input CASAllow the CAS to continue in the flowQuietly drop the CAS, do not return it and do not generate an exceptionSimple Aggregate with internal CMStop generating any more children/descendants from the input CAS and return the exception on the input CASAllow the CAS to continue in the flow (it will be dropped at the end of the flow)Quietly drop the CAS as if it reached the end of the flow, and do not generate an exceptionCurrently our aggregate error-handling supports #2, while #3 doesn't depend on the framework.  I have added aggregate support for #3 to the AdvancedFixedFlowController in the UIMA-AS test suite (as part of Jira 1353) in the form of a new AllowDropOnFailure option which specifies the delegates for which a failing CAS can be dropped, i.e. skip to the end of the flow with the forceCasToBeDropped flag set.  (I used it to test the thresholdWindow error handling to verify that an intermittently failing delegate is disabled when N of the last M CASes fail.)But I don't think our docs indicate what should happen in #1 and the current implementation handles it differently ... the exception is associated with the child CAS without any reference to the input CAS, and the CM continues to generate children, so the client can get many exceptions that refer to unknown CASes.  The getParentCasReferenceId() method in the UimaASProcessStatus (which I could not find in the JavaDocs) can be used to associate a child CAS with the input CAS that generated it, but it is always null when an exception is returned. Consider the information available to the entityProcessComplete callback when an input CAS successfully generates 2 children:returnedCAS  getCasReferenceId() getParentCasReferenceId() isException()  Child1   ID-of-Child1   ID-of-Parent  false  Child2   ID-of-Child2   ID-of-Parent  false  Parent   ID-of-Parent   null    false If the 2nd child causes an exception then the client might see (Option A)returnedCAS  getCasReferenceId() getParentCasReferenceId() isException()  Child1   ID-of-Child1   ID-of-Parent  false  null   ID-of-Parent   null    trueOr we could put the failing child's ID in the status (Option B)returnedCAS  getCasReferenceId() getParentCasReferenceId() isException()  Child1   ID-of-Child1   ID-of-Parent  false  null   ID-of-Child2   ID-of-Parent  trueNote that in an Aggregate CM the failing CAS may not have been generated directly by the parent, but by any one of its descendants.I think option A  is cleaner and easier to document ... "exception always on input CAS".  If the ID of the failing child is useful we could wrap the exception in another that said something like "Exception inherited from generated CAS xyz"Any other options we should consider?I'll put this in a Jira as that may be the better place to discuss it.

texts:Access to individual type index iterators
UIMA feature structure iterators for a given type always include its subtypes. While this is generally the best thing to do, if an application requires more precise control over the types it needs an ability to iterate over the instances of a specific type only, leaving the subtypes out. In the current UIMA this is not possible to achieve.This is especially important for performance as iterating over an aggregate index is vastly more complicated than listing an individual index. In certain real-world scenarios using our AFST engine we are able to achieve close to 20% performance improvement on complete processing pipelines by simply giving the AFST type set iterator access to individual type iterators.The attached patch implements a new "ll_leafIterator()" method in LowLevelIndex which returns an iterator over the root type of an index. It also includes a simple alternative to FSIndexRepositoryImpl.PointerIterator for leaf types, also improving the performance when iterating over leaf types.

texts:Concurrent modification checks dominate index iteration time.
Iterating over the annotation index with even a moderate number of defined types is dominated by the time spent checking individual indexes for concurrent modification. This is due to the fact that concurrent modification checks are done on all types being iterated over, even if the iteration only needs to process a couple of iterators. In fact, checking all iterators for modification has linear complexity in the number of subiterators used, while the actual iteration can be implemented with logarithmic complexity using e.g. a binary heap.The UIMA documentation and JavaDoc do not state that the iterators should always recognize concurrent modification (FSIterator JavaDoc states "Implementations of this interface are not required to be fail-fast. That is, if the iterator's collection is modified, the effects on the iterator are in general undefined."). It thus makes sense to reduce the number of iterators being tested for concurrent modification at each moveToNext() step.The attached patch replaces the checkConcurrentModificationAll() call in FSIndexRepositoryImpl.PointerIterator.moveToNext() with concurrent modification checks on only the iterators being used by the step; as the iterator becomes invalid it also checks all involved iterators for modification. By doing this it should be able to catch almost all concurrent modification without the excessive overhead.In one of our performance tests iterating over the annotation index with 140 types defined is more than twice faster after the attached patch is applied.

texts:Code trying to ensure reverse iterators list items in the opposite order of forward ones is present but not working
FSIndexRepositoryImpl contains pieces of code that are meant to ensure forward and reverse iterators are inverses of each other by doing additional comparison by FS address to resolve equality. However, this is not fully implemented and isn't working properly.The iteratorComparator defined by the PointerIterator class is not used for sorting elements in moveToNext() and moveToPrevious(), where the default comparators for the iterators are used instead. For the typical use of PointerIterator of listing the annotation index this does not cause a problem as the type priorities ensure ordering between indexes of different types, while the ordering is always defined within the individual indexes.The piece of code implementing the extra comparison should either be removed or corrected.

texts:Binary heap annotation iterator implementation
The attached patch is a logarithmic complexity implementation of FSIndexRepositoryImpl.PointerIterator. The implementation maintains a binary heap of indexes and a short sorted section before the start of the heap to avoid spending more time than the old UIMA iterator when a couple of types completely dominate the heap.It offers small advantage when iterating over a small number of types and should be significantly faster for large numbers of types, as well as in situations where moveToNext() is not the only operation used on the iterator.

The dictionary structure is flexible, allowing any number synonyms to be associated with an entry, and any number of attributes to be associated with entries or synonyms. Lookup and matching against dictionary entries can be performed against contiguous or non-contiguous blocks of text, and token order independant lookup is also allowed (for example, the tokens "A" "B" would be considered a match against dictionary entry "B" "A"). Additionally, ConceptMapper can be configured to use any tokenizer annotator, enabling tokenization of its dictionaries identically with the input text.

The Uima AS aggregate sometimes tries to use a wrong CAS pool when deserializing CASes received from a remote CM. The aggregate stores a key of the delegate CM in a cache before sending a CAS to the delegate. When the Aggregate receives a child CAS, it looks up the cache with parent CAS id and retrieves the CM delegate key. Sometimes, when the aggregate looks up the CM delegate key it receives a key of the next CM suggesting that the state of cache entry changes unexpectedly.

texts:Example MeetingFinderCPE_withXmlDetagging.xml doesn&#39;t work
Reported by user on alphaWorks forum:I recently started working with UIMA and have still some problems especially with one Collection Processing Engine, that was provided with UIMA examples. The CPE's name is MeetingFinderCPE_WithXmlDetagging. I haven't yet changed anything about the Java or XML code and it seems to me there is an error which originates either from distribution incompabilities or maybe there is an error in some part of the code. I keep receiving an error message that reads:com.ibm.uima.analysis_engine.AnalysisEngineProcessException: Annotator processing failed. Caused by: CASRuntimeException: No sofaFS with name xmlDocument found.As I have only found a bad solution to this problem, it would be great if someone might take care of it, especially since it is an example that is not mentioned in the tutorial. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Adam:There are two issues:  (a) The CPE GUI doesn't support sofaMappings at all.(b) The example descriptor tried to supply a CollectionReader sofa Mapping that mapped the Collection Reader's initialView to a CPE Sofa called "rawDocument".  This isn't supported - it results in an error saying "rawDocument" is not found before the CollectionReader is even called.  Should this be supported?

texts:Client of a CAS Multiplier should be able to stop processing of a CAS
Normally the number of CASes generated by a Cas Multiplier is determined by the CM itself, but with an aggregate CM that number may be hard to anticipate or control.  Some applications may not need all of the generated CASes ... they may be satisfied once an appropriate amount of information has been returned.Hence it would be convenient for the client to be able to request that the CM stop generating CASes, and if an aggregate, stop processing any internal CASes generated from the input CAS.  Such a request is probably only useful for CMs acting as pure segmenters ... if the CM is merging CASes or resegmenting them then the process could be terminated by the application upon receiving an end-of-stream CAS.  It might be an acceptable simplification to have the stop request stop all processing of active CASes, but then again it may be easily handled by the changes being made to stop an aggregate CM when a generated CAS produces an exception.

But each spring context files defines singleton objects that are not meant to be used externally. An example of such non-shared singleton would the InProcessCache. It is meant to be shared by components defined in a single context file. There are few possibly solutions here:1) modify dd2spring to assign unique names to spring beans to prevent sharing across context files. 2) modify uima-as deployer to deploy each context file in a separate spring container3) find a way to prevent spring from sharing singleton objects across context files.

The behavior can easily confuse users becausethe uima.tcas.Annotation type is not necessarily visualized in the editor. The default type should be changed to the mode type of the editor, since the mode type is always shown and often thats also the type a user needs.

texts:Annotation Editor updates are too slow when it displays a huge number of annotations
The Annotation Editor needs to much time to update the displayed text with annotations when the annotation model behind it is updated. The implementation right now triggers a repaint for remove and add AnnotationFS operations and two repaints for an update to an existing AnnotationFS.These repaints can take around a second on a newspaper article which is visualized with all token annotations. This huge delay makes the Cas Editor nearly unusable.

texts:UIMA AS service creates too many JMS connections
UIMA AS service maintains connections to client's reply queue. These connections are cached and reused. When the connection becomes idle for too long, it is closed. Current default connection timeout is set to 30 minutes. This value can be changed via System property -DSessionTimeoutOverride=n.JMS Connections are expensive, and if too many are created the broker may become unstable. As optimization, the service should create a single JMS connection (per broker) and use it to create jms sessions and message producers for each client. This change will  reduce number of threads the broker needs to manage in deployments where clients and services use a single broker for messaging.

texts:UIMA AS client creates too many JMS connections to a broker
Currently, a JMS Connection is created for every instance of UIMA AS client. When scaling UIMA AS client in the same JVM, this results in many connections to the same Broker.

Subsequent UIMA AS client instances should reuse the connection to create JMS sessions. The connection will be closed when all client instances call stop() method.

texts:UimacppAnalysisComponent doesn&#39;t support ResultSpecification
It looks like UimacppAnalysisComponent will always pass a null result specification through the JNI.  This should be fixed once the C++ enablement layer is ready.Note that the new Java annotator interfaces have a setResultSpecification(ResultSpecification) method, rather than including a ResultSpecification on the process call.  We could consider doing that in C++ as well.  This has the advantage of notifying the annotator only when the result spec changes, so the annotator doesn't waste time checking the result spec on every process call.

texts:Instantiating top level pearSpecifier: reconfigure throwing NPE and need to set Session
A user reported these two issues when trying to run a top level pear.  See http://markmail.org/thread/jbacko4l6jyonzse A discussion with Adam L indicates the problem may be being caused by the fact that the PearSpecifier interface extends the ResourceServiceSpecifier, and things would work better if it extended the ResourceCreationSpecifier - in that the cause of the NPE which is a null value for the map representing the configuration parameters, in the method ConfigurationManagerImplBase.validateConfigurationParameterSettings.  This map is setup by Resource_ImplBase if the specifier is a subtype of ResourceCreationSpecfier, but not otherwise.Also, the session is setup, but again, only if the specifier is a subtype of ResourceCreationSpecifier.  So, the first thing to investigate is to see if we can switch this, and what the impact would be.

texts:Saving of annotations and relations does not always work properly
We have encountered a problem concerning saving manually annotated documents with the Apache UIMA CasEditor.In short, not all annotations and relations are always saved when saving an xmi file. That is, oftentimes we save an annotated document and reopen it with the annotation editor, some of the annotations and all relations are missing.We are not quite sure what the underlying problem is and we even didn't manage to always reproduce it, but this is what we've done and observed:After importing a text file (.txt) and opening its corresponding xmi file with the annotation editor we annotated some entities and created relations among them afterwards. We then saved and closed that file. Reopening it again, in most cases the first couple of annotations still existed. However, subsequent annotations and, especially, all relations were missing.An interesting observation that might help to find the actual problem is the following: When we annotated and saved the same previously edited document again, everything worked fine, i.e. all annotations and relations had actually been saved.

Please make this text available under http://incubator.apache.org/uima/sandbox.html#lucene.consumer (which is already published):Lucene CAS indexer (Lucas)The Lucene CAS indexer (Lucas) is a UIMA CAS consumer that stores CAS data in a Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org) index. The consumer transforms annotation objects of a CAS into Lucene token streams which are stored in a Lucene document. Token streams can further be processed by token filters. Lucas comes with a set of own token filters and integrations for some Lucene token filters. Furthermore, you can deploy your own token filters. The mapping between UIMA annotations and Lucene tokens and token filtering is configured by a xml mapping file. The Java source of the consumer can be accessed in the SVN repository at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/Lucas.

texts:Fix race condition in the UIMA As client when creating a shared JMS connection
When scaling a UIMA AS client in the same JVM there is a race condition that causes NullPointer exception. The exception is thrown when trying to access a JMSConnection object that is not yet initialized. The problem is in the setupConnection() method where the SharedConnection is initialized in two steps:1) Default constructor creates an instance of the SharedConnection2) setConnection method is called with a new Connection objectThe problem is that the code in initialize() method checks if the sharedConnection != null and if so proceeds to initializeProducer() method. So the race condition is that SharedConnection constructor  finishes, a thread sees that it is not null and calls initializeProducer BEFORE the connection is set.Fix the code so that connection is passed in as an argument to a constructor assuring that as soon as the SharedConnection is instantiated it is fully initialized

texts:Using getSofaDataStream instead of getDocumentText
I would like to known if it could be better to get the CAS text content by calling the getSofaDataStream method of the CAS class instead of getting it by the getDocumentText one.Actually, CAS sofas can be set either by calling the setSofaDataString method (aka setDocumentText), or by calling the setSofaDataArray one, or by calling the setSofaDataURI one. However, the getDocumentText method (aka getSofaDataString) provides the content of CASes whose sofas are only set by the first method whereas the getSofaDataStream method retieves content whatever the called method. A method able to get String from an InputStream is then needed.Am I wrong in thinking it's an Improvement?

texts:Need a script to launch a UIMA-AS service via RunWithJarPath
Use existing RunWithJarPath.class from the core to enable loading jars dynamically when launching UIMA AS service. Currently setUimaClasspath is called to setup static classpath before deployment of UIMA_Service. For more flexibility it would be better to load all jar files from specified locations instead of depending on them to be statically defined in setUimaClasspath. One of the reasons for supporting dynamically loaded jars is the naming scheme used by ActiveMQ. Each version comes with a differently named jars like for exampleapache-activemq-4.1.1.jar, activemq-all-5.2.0.jar, etc.

Some issues to resolve for the Lucas POM1) it specifies in distributionManagement <url>scp://login.coling.uni-jena.de/var/lib/maven/coling</url>This looks like it might left over from its life elsewhere.  I think the distributionManagement element should be deleted.2) factor out ant executions for copying standard stuff - done in parent3) There is a section of the POM specifying actions for the phase "site".   We currently do not run a mvn site lifecycle as part of our build process, so I think this will never execute.   Its purpose is to copy to the ${project.build.directory}/site/downloads the downloadable artifacts: the jar and the pear.I think we can leave this in as a comment reminding us in the future if we go to individually downloadable things from our main website, how we might want to do this.4) There is an execution in the Ant-run for building the pear directories that will be bound up with the pear.  This adds  doc/ with a copy of the generated html and pdf from the docbook sources, Should these be included in the PEAR?  They are already included in the binary distribution of the Sandbox. doc/downloads with 2 files: the lucas.xsd, and a sample CasConsumer descriptor.  Do these belong in the PEAR? They are already included in the src and binary distribution of the Sandbox resources dir for the PEAR is populated with the contents of src/test/resources.  This seems a bit unusual - why are the test resources being included in the PEAR?5) The PearPackagingMavenPlugin is setting a classpath that includes $main_root/lib/cglib-nodep-2.1_3.jar  - but this jar is not present.  What is it? can this be deleted? $main_root/lib/google-collect-snapshot-20080530.jar $main_root/lib/log4j-1.2.14.jar $main_root/lib/lucene-core-2.4.0.jar - needs updating to proper level $main_root/lib/lucene-snowball-2.4.0.jarThese need  updating to proper level, which is no level since the level was stripped from the /lib

texts:CAS / CasView API refactoring
1.  GoalsThe following are confusing (or some might say, "broken")(a) the interface "CAS" can be an interface to either the whole CAS or to aview.  Methods like this are poor:CAS view = cas.getView(name);(b) the logic determining which "CAS" (a view or the whole CAS) getspassed to anannotator's process method is needlessly complicated.We would like to improve this in v2.1, so we have a short runway to implement it.  It's acceptable if what we do breaks multi-viewannotators/applicatoins, but it cannot break single-view annotators/applications.We want whatever we do to be easier to document and explain to usersthan what we currently have.2. Proposed SolutionWe don't plan to change the fundamental design of views at this point there isn't time and it's too controversial.  A view still consistsof an index repository and a Sofa.  (Yes, I know someday a view maynot have a Sofa - but for now, it does.)A. New CasView interfaceWe create a new interface CasView.  All of the CAS.getView() methodswill now return type CasView (instead of CAS).The CasView interface will contain all of the sofa-access methods andindexing-related methods that are on the CAS interface.Further discussion: http://www.mail-archive.com/uima-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg00945.htmlProposed sets of methods on each interface: http://cwiki.apache.org/UIMA/casandcasviewinterfaceredesign.html

texts:Regularize Sandbox builds and assembly
Converge the many, often slightly different sandbox builds into a more maintainable structure, achieving the following: common pear packaging for those projects making a pear, including standardized setting of the pear-id, and the copying of any "lib" files found via dependency plugin to the pear lib dir.. common preparation of the "bin" and "src" assembly parts, to make the assembly step easier and consistent.  The assembly step will be very minimal, because each project will have pre-built in target/bin/<artifactId> and target/src/<artifactId> the set of files that should go into the "bin" and "src" distributions.  This approach allows using the maven inheritance mechansim to factor out common operations, so they are more maintainable (versus using a very large and complex "assembly" descriptor). common obtaining of 3rd party Jars to be distributed with sandbox projects, and putting of these into both the "bin" distribution (assembly) and the pear (if one is generated).  Also, any other contents of a top level lib/ will be copied to both of these places in the lib/ directory. common setting of scopes for dependencies for included uima components - some set to "provided", others to "test". The correct scopes are needed to make the dependency pluging reliably pick the right Jars to put into the lib. common build of documentation (if available) from docbook sources, and placing that in both the "bin" assembly, and also in a project/"docs" directory - where the intent is that it will be checked in to SVN, and the website can link to this as "online" documentation for the sandbox projects. common copying of generated docs into pear now that dependencies are being used to get the 3rd party jars, review these to insure all the right jars are being obtained, and adjust the dependencies as needed. for those project using a top level folder "desc" to hold descriptors, include these descriptors in the generated main Jar, where they can be then referenced by "name".  Example: the Whitespace Annotator did this, and the Tagger used this to conveniently run the Whitespace Annotator without using/installing a PEAR. common copying of required LICENSE/NOTICE/DISCLAIMER, plus README files to the src/bin assemblies, and to the PEAR if one is generated. common copying of top level desc and resources directories to the bin, src, (automatically done for  PEAR by pear-packaging-plugin)

The scripts have been failing when it comes to doing the doc building, because they are missing saxon, jai, and the docbook 4.5 xml files; the script tries to get these from the internet (with permission) but fail on the 2nd request due to a problem of getting Ant I/O to the "console" to work more than once when Ant is invoked from maven.  Also, it's a nuisance.  Change this to attempt to copy over any of this tooling that might be in the same projects that contain the "extractAndBuild" scripts in the first place.  So - if you've fixed those up once, these will be reused. regularize the arguments - so they all take 2 args for the release and release-candidate, so all extractAndBuild args are the same. for the sandbox build - fix the assembly to include the -N parameter - no need to build twice.

If an AnalysisEngine descriptor declares multipleDeploymentAllowed=false, the intention is that there cannot be multiple instances of it in the same JVM.  UIMA reports an error if you try to embed such an AE in an aggregate that declares multipleDeploymentAllowed=true.  But this only makes sense for co-located components, not services.Currently, the service wrapper returns the multipleDeploymentAllowed=false as part of the getMetaData() call.   The aggregate AE checks this metadata for consistency, and at that point it isn't aware that it came from a service, so the exception is thrown.Perhaps the service wrapper should be modified to set mutlipleDeploymentAllowed to true when responding to all getMetaData() calls?  Alternatively it could be done on the client side, but to me it makes more sense for the service to do it - why expose this setting if clients have no use for it?

changed files:uimaj-core/src/main/java/org/apache/uima/cas/impl/FSIndexRepositoryImpl.java
texts:moveTo() and iterator(fs) do not point to "leftmost" FS
According to the API docs FSIterator.moveTo(FeatureStructure fs) should move the iterator to "the first features structure that is equal to fs". In case we have multiple annotations of same type and same region (same start/end) as fs moveTo() will point to one of them but not necessarily to the first (leftmost) one (in iterator order).The inconsistency to the API doc is even more clear with FSIndex.iterator(FeatureStructure fs). The API doc states: "The position of the iterator will be set such that the feature structure returned by a call to the iterator's  get() method is greater than or equal to fs, and any previous FS is less than FS." Thus if we have multiple annotations of same type as fs and same region one would expect the iterator to start with the left most one and return all of these annotations using next(). However as with moveTo() this is not the case. E.g. after iterator creation calling moveToPrevious() followed by get() returns sometimes one of the annotations with same region as fs (and same type).

texts:run Rat consistently for all maven assemblies
Make all assemblies and RAT testing of those assemblies work the same way (convention over configuration).  Have common parent POM concerned with doing assemblies, and have the 3 distribution poms (that build the base, uima-as, and sandbox distributions) use this as a common parent.Builds are done in the "package" lifecycle.  After build is done, in the "verify" lifecycle (just before "install), run the RAT tool.  Incorporate into the distribution POMs the set of RAT exclusions.  Include a step of unpacking the assemblies (because the RAT tool doesn't work on zips).Running mvn install will now do the assemblies and do the RAT testing.  This effectively automates future RAT testing.Running mvn install on the new superPom for distributions will build all 3 distributions (base, sandbox, and uima-as, not uima-cpp).  Insure the assemblies are not uploaded to the maven repo's - (they're big, not jars, and should instead be downloaded from our website). After this change, to build distributions, do mvn install, not mvn assembly:assembly, on the distribution POMs.  Cripple mvn assembly:assembly so some kind of error message comes out reminding to use mvn install instead. Update website with new instructions on building distributions.

texts:Uima AS service should start listeners on its input queue on succesfull initialization only
Currently UIMA AS service JMS listener starts as soon as it is initialized. There are two listeners started on an input queue each with a different selector. One listener is for processing GetMeta while the other for Process messages. The listeners start in separate threads and become active despite the fact that the rest of service components may not have finished initializing. This creates a problem if the service fails in annotator code while initializing. Since the GetMeta listener is active, it may fetch GetMeta request from a queue and try to process it. The current code prevents the GetMeta from being processed since the service has not finished initializing. If the AE initialization fails, the getMeta is never returned to the client. Fix input queue listeners so that they become active only after successful initializationof AEs. In case of aggregates, allow listeners on temp reply queues to start immediately so that GetMeta replies from delegates can be processed.

texts:deployCppService does not return <elementType> on getMeta replies
3. I deployed the uimacpp AE service which has exactly the same typesystem as a uimaj AE in the pipeline. However, the CASes are incompatible with the following reason: There is a type 'Constituent' which has a 'children' feature. 'children' is of the range type 'FSArray' with the element type 'Constituent'. However, when getting the typesystem from the uimacpp service, the element type is ignored. Both components cannot be plugged into one pipeline, because of an exception complaining about incompatible typesystems.I will work around the last issue by altering the typesystem (removing the element type), but this is not satisfactory.Kind regardsMatthias

texts:UimaBootstrap Loader approach fails to work for classes loaded by logger (and maybe other parts of Java)
The bootstrap loader is creating a URLClassLoader whose parent is the application class loader - also the one obtained from ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() method.  The Logger configuration is defined to load classes uses the application class loader, and fails to find any of the classes made available by the bootstrap class loader.An attempted fix that used the -Djava.system.class.loader failed to work for IBM Java 5 because that Java doesn't use the loader returned by ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() to load the logger classes. Fix this by not creating a new class loader, and just adding the new jars and directories to the current application class loader, using reflection to enable accessing the addUrl method.  This approach presumes that the application class loader is a subclass of URLClassLoader, which seems to be true at least for Sun and IBM Javas, launched with the normal java command.

texts:UIMA AS service does not recover from broker failure and subsequent restart
When the broker dies and is subsequently restarted, the UIMA AS service recovers listeners on its input queue but it is not cleaning up its endpoints to remote delegates properly. In a request to the remote delegate, the service sends an old temp reply queue. This leads to JMS exceptions in the delegate while trying to reply to tmp destinations that no longer exist in a new broker. Fix the code to recover connection from a failed broker, clear the cache of delegate endpoints, create a new temp reply queue and listener and add a new temp reply queue to the outgoing request message.

When the connection to the broker is lost, the UIMA AS client does not attempt to reconnect as it is done in the UIMA AS service. When the jms send() fails due to a lost connection, the UIMA AS client notifies the application but in addition should log a single message that the connection was lost  and enter a recovery loop attempting to reconnect at regular intervals. Any failures during this recovery should be silently handled. If the application does not want to recover from a bad connection it should call stop() on the client API which will stop the recovery, cleanup resources and terminate the UIMA AS client.

While creating an endpoint connection to a delegate, the aggregate creates a temp reply queue in JmsOutputChannel.getEndpointConnection() for no apparent reason.

These redundant queues actually cause one of the testcases in the extended test to fail intermittently.

texts:UIMA AS aggregate not handling timeouts correctly for parallel delegates
Burn discovered a bug in UIMA AS aggregate while handling timeouts from delegates in a parallel step. A delegate timeout that is subsequently disabled (due to error handling setting action=disable), causes error handling code to (incorrectly) double increment the count of delegates that responded. The count is maintained to determine how many delegates in a parallel step responded and if it is ok to allow the CAS to continue with the flow. This counter is incremented when a reply comes or there is a timeout. When the counter reaches the expected number, the CAS is allowed to continue on with flow. The double increment causes a CAS to continue in the flow prematurely.

If set to less than the number of instance, the user does not get the expected performance improvement and its too easy to get this wrong.

The part of the PEAR system which sets up the class path (implemented in buildComponentClassPath method) can be run in two modes, one for "packaging" and the other for use at "runtime".  The difference is that the "runtime" just uses the specified classpath, while the "packaging" creates a classpath adding jars found in the lib/ directory.  The Maven plugin to create a package should use the "packaging" version.  This will help with backwards compatibility.While changing things, the Maven plugin should use a definite order for building the classpath, starting with the actual artifact, any entries in a user-specified classpath, and then the jars from the lib directory, last (in arbitrary order).  And it should not add things to the classpath that are already there (remove duplicates).

texts:fix some miscompares between svn export and source-distribution
It was noted in reviewing our release candidate that a diff between our source distribution and the export of the svn tag are somewhat different.  Some of these are due to the source distribution copying things like licenses, disclaimers, readmes, etc., to the top level of the source distribution - so these are fine.  Others are due to things we use in development, which are not used to build the distributions.  (example: some build scripts like signEclipseUpdateSite,  or the project uimaj-jet-expander - only used when changing the jcas gen templates and regenerating the corresponding java code, or the project uimaj-internal-tools - I think not currently used).Others are left-overs.  For instance, the docs for the PearPackagingMavenPlugin - these were merged into the main tools doc; however the old docs are still in SVN (but are not put into the source distribution).  I think I want to leave them there, because I think in the future we may be breaking out that project as a separately released item, and maybe adding to the maven tooling even...Finally, there are some things that should be fixed.  For instance, the docbook tooling downloads the FOP version.  but it also seems that we've checked into SVN some older levels of the FOP jar.  These should be removed.  Check the differences for uimaj, uima-as, and the Sandbox, and reduce the discrepancies.

When I create an aggregate descriptor from several installed pears (e.g., WS tokenizer, tagger & regex), the CDE creates an OOM situation on Eclipse 3.5 and Sun Java 6 on windows.

The UIMA AS service startup script sets this property -Dlog4j.configuration=file:c:\uima\releases\2.3.0-07\apache-uima\as_config\log4j.propertiesit is picked up by AMQ and Spring and used for logging. The same log4j.properties file is copied from as_config directory to UIMA_HOME/bin/amq/config when startBroker script is started for the first time. So, the same configuration is used by two different processes. This doesnt seem right. We most likely need different log4j.properties for each process since each of them needs to log at different level. For example, the broker needs to be started with INFO level logging to show status information on broker startup. Logging at INFO level when UIMA AS service starts may lead to excessive messages being logged. An instance of this is when a broker is killed  when a service is running. The broker failure forces listeners to reconnect using Spring's blocking call. This call produces log msgs at INFO level at 5 sec intervals. The fix would be to use a different property files. UIMA AS should use a basic configuration with a single log of say 100MB size and should log at WARNING level only.

texts:UIMA AS aggregate doesnt handle service broker restart
If a delegate service broker is restarted, the aggregate client doesnt attempt to recreate a listener to a temp reply queue. This may cause a hang or a timeout in the aggregate client. In this scenario there are two brokers: one managing aggregate service queue and a second that manages delegate service temp reply queue. When the latter is restarted, the dispatch code does not attempt to create a new listener. The aggregate code should detect a failure of the broker, mark a delegate as FAILED and kill the listener. On subsequent CAS request, the aggregate should attempt to create a new listener and a new JMS Connection to a broker. Failure to re-establish the connection is subject to error handling as defined in deployment descriptor Process error configuration for the delegate.

If an application creates multiple instances of UIMA AS client, each connected to a different service, a broker restart is not handled correctly.Only one instance of a client re-initializes correctly and handles the re-connect. Remaining client instances still use stale broker connection. When a connection failure is detected, the client code enters a loop trying to recover the connection. Once recovered, a singleton SharedConnection object is initialized with a new Connection, message listeners of all clients are restarted on new temp reply queues but MessageProducers are not re-initialized. Modify code that detects connection failure to invalidate MessageProducer in each client. Also, add code to detect invalid MessageProducer and force creation of a new instance using new Connection object.

Christoph Büscher  to uima-userI currently encountered a problem with the XMI deserialization of a feature structure after calling a remote C++ AS annotator from a CPE.

The exact URL causing the problem is:documentURL="http://www.gesundheitsnachrichten.net/live/navigation/live.php?navigation_id=11&_psmand=1"2. The CAS get's serialized to XMI before sending it to a remote C++ TAE. I added a breakpoint to UimaSerializer.serializeCasToXmi() and get the following part in the XMI string:documentURL="http://www.gesundheitsnachrichten.net/live/navigation/live.php?navigation_id=11&_psmand=1"So here the "&" character seems to be excaped correctly.3. When the document comes back, the same feature in the XMI string received in UimaSerializer.deserializeCasFromXmi() reads:documentURL="http://www.gesundheitsnachrichten.net/live/navigation/live.php?navigation_id=11&_psmand=1"an now the SAXParser throws the following exception:org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The reference to entity "_psmand" must end with the ';' delimiter.       at org.apache.xerces.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.parse(Unknown Source)       at org.apache.uima.aae.UimaSerializer.deserializeCasFromXmi(UimaSerializer.java:170)       at ...because the "&" comes back unescaped.-----------------------------------Christoph Büscher to uima-userI did some further testing and the problem seems to happen when the FS is notdeclared in the remote C++ TAE but declared and set in an AE in the (lokal) main application (in out case a CPE running various Java AEs).------------------------------------------Nice work Christoph!

texts:Trailing blank following log property level causing problems with IBM Java 6
Well, you'll have trouble believing this one.  We had a logging issue which we finally isolated to only failing on IBM Java 6, not on IBM Java5 or on Sun Javas.  The issue was that the setting of the logger, done by uncommenting the last line in the distributed Logger.properties file (it's in uimaj-distr, /src/main/properties/Logger.properties) is written as &#35; To set the logging level for the UIMA framework itself, specify:&#35; org.apache.uima.level = ALL where there is a "blank" following the word "ALL".The properties file is read using the Properties.load method, which preserves that trailing blank.  This makes the setting for the level not compare equal to any of the defined levels.  In most other Java impls, the value of the level is "trimmed" before the compare, but not in IBM's Java 6 SR 3 impl.You can see this for yourself, with a tiny test case:  public static void main(String[] args) {    Logger log = Logger.getLogger("org.apache.uima");    log.log(Level.FINEST, "Test");    log.log(Level.INFO, "info");  }Set up a logger.properties file with the org.apache.uima level setting at FINEST with a trailing blank, and try on the various Javas...Fix for now: change our default properties file to remove the trailing blank on the commented-out line.

texts:Java and UIMA things holding on to objects loaded via Resource Manager fail when switching to another Resource Manager class loader instance
JNDI and JMX both use "system-wide" "registries" of objects.  These objects, for uima-as, can be loaded from a Resource Manager in cases where the uima-as classes are on the Resource Manager's classpath.  A use case where this can occur is a UIMA aggregate containg 2 PEAR descriptors, each having a potentially different version of uima-as in the PEAR's classpath, being used as a client to a remote uima-as service.  (Note that the uima-as client for this is represented in UIMA as a "custom resource specifier", so this use case can also apply to future "custom resources".)The system-wide registries for JNDI and JMX use a string handle to locate objects, and cache found objects in the registry.  The first use loads the object, using the class loader in effect at the place where the lookup is requested.  For uima-as being used as a custom resource, the class loader used is the UIMA class loader associated with the current resource manager.If, subsequently, another resource manager instance (actually, another class loader instance within the UIMA resource manager) is used to run the uima-as classes, the lookups by name for objects in these registries will succeed, but will return objects that were loaded under a different class loader.  This causes ClassCastExceptions, because the superclasses / interfaces used in the currently running code (running under the 2nd classloader) no longer are the superclasses / interfaces of the objects retrieved under the 1st classloader.See http://markmail.org/message/2r5coddmuuprucyk for discussion of this issue in the context of running the Configuration Descriptor Editor (CDE).

The uima-as jms client design contract is to call "stop" after a call to "initialize", in order to clean up sockets, etc.  However, base uima code has methods that call initialize just get client metadata, e.g.,  CasCreationUtilities.getMetaDataList, which are general purpose and are supposed to work for any analysis engine resource.I think the jms client should figure out how to clean up after itself.  Using finalize for this is not a good idea, for the standard reasons (see end of article http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/finalization/ ).  Perhaps we need to call destroy after the call to produceResource, and insure that destroy is implemented by JmsAnalysisEngineServiceAdapter (and others) to release/cleanup

Once set, it remains the same for the duration of the client. There is no way to change it in the middle of the run. Some applications may need to adjust the timeout on per CAS basis. The same functionality (dynamically controlled timeout) may also be useful for UIMA AS services. The exact mechanism for implementing this new feature is up for debate. For UIMA AS client, perhaps a new client API can be added to change the timeout value. The application would change the timeout, call send ( synchronous or asynchronous), and change the timeout value back to what it was when the reply is received. Another approach would be to add the timeout value to the CAS and have the UIMA AS client check for it before forwarding the CAS to a service. Yet another approach would be JMX, although this seems cumbersome.

texts:Long GC causes UIMA AS service to loose broker connection and marks the client as dead
When the JVMs GC takes a long time, the UIMA AS fails to validate the broker connection and proceeds to close it as if the broker died. It seems that the long GC freezes the jvm and prevents the low level socket pinging to work correctly. This pinging is a mechanism by which the low level AMQ code relies upon to detect a broker failure. In this case, the broker is actually fine. The side effect of the above is that the UIMA AS service falsely adds the client to the DoNotProcess list. This is an optimization that was recently added that prevents wasting processing cycles while handling CASes that are known to have come from clients that had gone away. Each CAS origin is checked against that list and if there is a match the CAS is thrown away. It seems that we need a better mechanism to detect broker failure.

texts:CPM doesnt validate registered CallbackListener references
The CPM uses a list of registered listeners to notify an application of certain events. The application registers listeners with the CPM before it starts the run. Apparently, the CPM doesnt validate a listener reference provided by the application and blindly adds it a list. If the reference is null, the NPE is thrown when trying to send notifications. Fix the code to validate listener reference to prevent adding null references.

texts:Create Default Bag Indexes when addFsToIndexes is called but no index has been defined for that type
The basic idea is that CAS.addFsToIndexes(FS) andIndexRepository.addFs(FS) should always add the FS to an index.  Ifno appropriate index occurs we just create a bag index.  The FS can beretrieved by using IndexRepository.getAllIndexedFS(Type).The thinking is that if an annotator bothered to try to add somethingto the indexes, there was a reason for it, and it's a whole lot betterto respect that than to just silently ignore it.Note that this doesn't cause any loss in performance if an annotatornever adds an FS to the indexes.  We still support subordinate FS thatare linked off of other FS but never indexed.More discussion here: http://www.mail-archive.com/uima-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg01132.html

texts:UIMA AS Aggregate not exposing number of consumer threads on its delegate&#39;s reply queues
UIMA AS Spring listener uses a single thread per delegate to handle replies. If a deployment descriptor is configured to process replies using multiple threads, the UIMA AS creates a concurrent listener with a thread pool to which the single-threaded Spring listener delegates all reply messages. This logic was added to assure that the parent CAS is always processed ahead of its children. The problem is that a JMX console shows a single JMS Consumer on a reply queue. This is correct, but the number of threads in the concurrent listener should be shown in the UIMA AS MBeans.

texts:UIMA AS aggregate may hang when one of its primitive delgates fails during initialization
There is a race condition in UIMA AS that may lead to a hang while trying to stop an aggregate service with multiple primitive delegates. If one of the delegates fails during initialization and the DD says to terminate, the aggregate sends STOP event to each delegate to force clean shutdown. When a primitive is instantiating AE via produceAnalysisEngine() call and the STOP comes on another thread, the state of the service is changed to stopped. When the AE is finally initialized and produceAnalysisEngine() returns, the code does not check for service status and proceeds to call postInitialize() which spins a cleanup thread and marks the service as initialized successfully. There are two problems:1) Primitive service doesnt check if it has been stopped after produceAnalysisEngine()  returns2) In postInitialize(), the primitive service always starts a cleanup thread no matter what the status of the service is. This cleanup thread is never stopped and leads to a hang.

texts:Incorrect description of getCAS() method in UIMA AS documentation
Chapter 4.2 The UimaAsynchronousEngine Interface describes UIMA AS client interface. Its description of getCAS() tells the reader to call reset() or release() on the CAS before calling getCAS() again. This is wrong when the client application uses an async style of sending CASes using sendCAS() method. When using async calls, the framework actually releases a CAS after the user's listener callback completes. The code calls release() if the user callback is not provided. The only time when the user's code must call release() or reset() is when the synchronous calls are made via sendAndReceive(). In this style of invocation, the framework does not call release() nor reset() and it is user's responsibility to do so.

This includes:  switching to docbkx maven plugin instead of our own docbook tooling (see other subtask) using maven-remote-resources plugin for including common, shared things, rather than referring to other projects (see other subtask) use POM dependencies from the repositories2) make POMs inherit from Apache master POM.3)  separate parent poms from aggregation poms.4) make POMs inherit from Apache common POM5) make parent poms separately releasable, using the apache/maven convention for version numbering (single digit).6) position aggregator poms in the conventional position (not flat structure) to enable some plugins (assembly and release) to function better.

According to the docs, thedefinition of Tokens contained in the NamendEntity is in thestrict=false setting defined as:  annot.getBegin() <= b.getBegin() <= annot.getEnd()for NamedEntity annot and Token b. This is true for 'UIMA' and'UIMA-Framework', but the subiterator is empty.If I change the NamedEntity to ' UIMA' (including the preceeding space),then it works correctly, and the Token 'UIMA-Framework' is contained inthe subiterator.I appended a simple java class with all needed files to demonstrate theproblem.

texts:UIMA AS Client sends a CPC request too soon
The scenario that leads to the problem involves an application that sends multiple CASes. Immediately after sending each CAS, the application sends a CPC. So the sequence is: CAS1 - CPC - CAS2 - CPC - CASn - CPC.When UIMA AS client times out waiting for a CAS reply from a service it marks a service as timed out. If a an application sends another CAS, the UIMA AS client detects the state of the service as timed out, sends a GetMeta Ping to a service and places the CAS on a pending list. The control is than returned to the application. If the application calls collectionProcessComplete() method, the UIMA AS client, while still waiting for GetMeta Ping reply,  sends a CPC request to a service. When the GetMeta Ping reply finally arrives, the UIMA AS client sends a CAS from a pending list to a service. In this scenario, the CPC ends up in the service queue ahead of a CAS. This is a wrong behaviour. The UIMA AS client should not send a CPC while still waiting for GetMeta Ping reply and certainly not before a pending CAS is sent.

texts:Documentation should be improved
The current CasEditor documentation is far to short to allow people a smooth start. We have been using the CasEditor a lot over the last year but were forced to write and maintain a "Getting Started" guide ourselves to work around this. Even after more than a year of working with it I still have not figured out how to get "Processors" to work.Unfortunately the editor is not self-explanatory and the lack of documentation is slowing adoption. One key point we noted for new users is the lack of mouse/context-menu equivalents for the most important functions (add/delete/edit annotations). Of course nobody will use them in the long run but that is where people look for the function. And that is also where the keyboard shortcut could be advertised.I think a sample project is crucial for better adoption (there is already a JIRA issue for that).I am attaching a PDF with the startup guide for our users. That is by no means perfect and some of it's content is covered by existing documentation. But it still may be helpful.

texts:UIMA AS aggregate CM hangs due to client not sending Free Cas Request
The UIMA AS client is not handling expired CASes coming from a Cas Multiplier aggregate.The scenario leading to a problem is as follows:The aggregate CM is configured with a single thread in a listener processing Process and CPC requests. The client is configured to timeout before the service sends a child CAS. The client is configured with no CPC timeout.UIMA AS client sends a CAS to an aggregate CasMultiplier which takes a long time to process (or there is a long GC). Before any child CASes are sent to a client, the client times out and sends a CPC. A bit later, the aggregate CM sends a child CAS. The client receives the CAS and finds that its parent CAS has expired. The client logs a message and ignores the CAS. The client is NOT sending the free Cas request to the aggregate CM, causing the aggregate to hang waiting for all of its CASes to be processed. Since the Free CAS never comes, the aggregate internal state is never updated and the thread processing the CPC is stuck (hangs). Modify UIMA AS client code to always send free cas request to a CM service.

texts:jcasgen: load the descriptor from the classpath
Hi,I would like to propose a small patch to the Jg class (org.apache.uima.tools.jcasgen.Jg). At the moment it is only possible to generate the source code for the typesystem when the corresponding descriptor file is located somewhere on your disk. I have the use case, where I want the typesystem descriptor to be contained inside a (company wide) jar. That means, I need to load the typesystem descriptor from the classpath.The attached patch adds a little bit of extra info to the "-jcasgeninput" parameter ind the "main1" method. If the value starts with "classpath:" the patch will try to look for everything after "classpath:" with its ClassLoader. If the ClassLoader can find the resource and the "outputDirectory" is not null, everything works. If the ClassLoader cannot find the resource, the corresponding error is generated.If the "-jcasgeninput" parameter does not start with "classpath:" everything works as before, only that the file is being converted to an URL instance that is given to the XMLInputSource object.What I am not sure about it the use of the "xmlSourceFileName" member variable and what it should contain if the descriptor is loaded from the classpath. Actually I don't even know what this variable does...I have not found any unittest for this class. So the code is tested with my maven mojo and works as expected. If anyone can provide me with more info about how to test the Eclipse plugin I could also test this, but I certainly need help there...Any comments? BestDaniel

texts:Add error handling option for UIMA AS services accessed by core UIMA
A core UIMA analysis engine has no error handling. Exceptions are passed back to the caller. Remote services accessed from a core aggregate AE add a timeout option which will generate a timeout exception.Marshall has a scenario where a scaled out UIMA aggregate AE running as a hadoop mapper has a remote delegate. This delegate is implemented as a UIMA AS service, accessed via a JMS client descriptor. In extremely rare cases the remote service takes too long to finish processing.In order for the hadoop job to complete successfully, Marshall would like a "continue on failure" option, where after a timeout the error is ignored and the original CAS sent to the remote service is used to continue processing in the core UIMA aggregate. This option is easy to implement with UIMA AS services, because a copy of the outstanding CAS is held by the client.The syntax would be to add an optional argument to the JMS client descriptor, e.g.<parameter name="ignore_process_errors" value="true"/>

texts:UIMA AS should provide a way to increase prefetch size on a reply queue
UIMA AS currently provides no way to change prefetch size on a reply queue. A default of 1 is used. This slows down the rate of processing messages by a service. Each UIMA AS service has a dedicated submitter thread whose main job is to deliver a message to a thread pool for processing. Since the submitter thread executes very fast and the prefetch=1 , the submitter thread is constantly waiting for the Broker to deliver the next message. Increasing prefetch forces the Broker to deliver multiple messages to a service which buffers them until the submitter thread is ready. The size of the prefetch should be equal to a scalout factor defined on each reply queue. The default is still 1. NOTE: increasing prefetch effects memory requirement for the service. The larger the prefetch the more messages are buffered taking up more memory.

texts:UIMA AS should block msg submitter thread if a thread pool is empty
If a queue scaleout factor > 1, the UIMA AS creates a thread pool and a managing Executor object. The threads in a pool are used to process incoming messages. A submitter thread receives a jms message via a callback from Spring and delivers it to the Executor for processing in one of the threads from the pool. If a thread pool is empty, the Executor policy is to use the submitter thread to process the message. Since there is a single submitter thread (per queue) this policy slows down the submitter thread and prevents it from delivering messages for processing by other threads.Change the code to prevent the submitter thread from doing processing. Instead, block the submitter thread if the thread pool becomes empty. As soon as a thread becomes available, the submitter thread should deliver a message and wait for a callback from Spring.

texts:xml namespace handling in XmiCasDocSerializer / NPE with Saxon in classpath
While experimenting with UIMA I observed a problem similar to the one already posted here: http://tinyurl.com/32spzv9. Since removing Saxon from the classpath was not an option, I found the problem to be the way namespaces are handled in org.apache.uima.cas.impl.XmiCasSerializer$XmiCasDocSerializer.First of all, the addAttribute/3 method was incorrectly passing null as uri and localName parameters. According to the javadoc, these must at least be empty strings. I added a hack to extract the localName from the qName, if available.Second, the method computeNamespaceDeclarationAttrs/1 only added namespaces as attributes, which are not honored by Saxon. I think this is correct, as the SAX2 standard states that namespaces must be declared via startPrefixMapping/2, so I added that, as well.Attached you find a patch with changes which work for me (and seem to solve the problem).

texts:Provide simple mechanism to capture all CASes input to specified delegate
The existing approach to capturing CASes sent to a component is to insert a new CAS-serializer-annotator just before it in the flow, or modify the component itself to serialize CASes. Both of these approaches require modifications to existing code and/or component descriptors, are somewhat time consuming and error prone.A much simpler approach is to just "turn on" CAS logging for a particular component using Java properties before starting the process, or to turn CAS logging on/off for an already running process using JMX operations.This issue covers using Java properties to turn on CAS logging for any delegate of an asynchronous aggregate.CAS logging would be controlled by the following properties:UIMA_CASLOG_BASE_DIRECTORY - optional; this is the directory under which other directories with XmiCas files will be created. If not specified, the processes current directory will be the base.UIMA_CASLOG_COMPONENT_ARRAY - This is a space separated list of delegates keys. If a delegate is nested inside a co-located async aggregate, the name would include the key name of the aggregate, e.g. "someAggName/someDelName". The XmiCas files will then be written into $UIMA_CASLOG_BASE_DIRECTORY/someAggName/someDelName/UIMA_CASLOG_TYPE_NAME - optional; this is the name of a FeatureStructure in the CAS containing a unique string to use the name each XmiCas file. If not specified, XmiCas file name will be NNN.xmi, where NNN is  the time in microseconds since the component was initialized.UIMA_CASLOG_FEATURE_NAME - optional unless if the TYPE_NAME is specified; this parameter gives the string feature to use. An example of type and feature names to use would be "org.apache.uima.examples.SourceDocumentInformation" and "uri".

The problem is caused by a bug in the Aggregate code that handles new CASes arriving from a nested Aggregate CM. The new CAS is added to the Top Level Aggregate LocalCache but the code is not incrementing a parent child count, resulting in a premature release of the parent in the top level aggregate. Another side effect of this is that the new CAS is not removed from a local cache if a lookup of a parent CAS fails. This leads to a hang if the application sends a CPC, since there is a CAS in the cache that is not removed but the CPC is only processed if the cache becomes empty.

However this doesn't work for dependencies that are within the <build> element.To get around this, release things in the build in the following order, updating components as needed before each release, to depend on things officially released  preceeding them.Suggested order *uima-jar-resource-bundle  (done)*parent-pom-top (depends in build section on above)  (done 7/8/2010)Next batch (no intra-project dependencies)*uima-build-helper-maven-plugin*uima-assembly-single-project*uima-docbook-resource-bundle*parent-pom-distr*parent-pom-docbookNext batch*parent-pom-ibm-notice*parent-pom-eclispe-plugins*parent-pom-annotator*parent-pom-distrNext*parent-pom-eclipse-plugins-ibm-noticeThe parent-pom-annotator has a dependency on PearPackagingMavenPlugin.Set this to 2.3.0-incubating for now; after uimaj has its first 2.3.1 non-incubating release,update this to 2.3.1.The aggregate-parent-poms project won't be released in this cycle; it has served its purpose(letting us climb the learning curve on using the release plugin), and will be released only if it is convenient in the future to re-release a bunch of these without concern for simultaneously updating the dependency versions in the <build> sections of the sub-modules.

The apache common pom ( http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/apache/7/apache-7.pom ) includes a repository for normal artifact resolution which points to the "snapshots" in repository.apache.org - the apache repo for snapshots (which is where UIMA artifact snapshots are deployed).  However, the Apache common POM assumes that you're not releasing any maven plugins.  The UIMA build tools include one maven plugin, and the uimaj toolkit include the pear-packaging-maven-plugin.  Therefore, we need to have a snapshot repo for the plugin repo.  Add the needed pluginRepositories element.

texts:Correct issues around building eclipse plugins and update site
While trying to test a patch for code used in a plugin, I tried building an eclipse update site and installing it, and found several problems.1) Some "BND" bundle instructions for dealing with split packages accidently duplicated an "exclude". The newer release of the maven-bundle-plugin now treates these duplicates differently, causing an invalid Eclipse manifest to be generated, which is only discovered when you try to install from the update-site, and you get messages like: Eclipse: uimaj-ep-configurator: Descriptor Editor 2.3.1.SNAPSHOT (org.apache.uima.desceditor 2.3.1.SNAPSHOT) requires 'package !org.eclipse.jface.text 0.0.0' but it could not be found    Note the "!" in front of the package name, which is caused by the duplicate exclude entry.  2) The uimaj-ep-jcasgen plugin didn't specify the correct parent, so the maven bundle plugin wasn't properly configured.3) The uimaj-ep-runtime plugin was depending on the maven-bundle-plugin:bundle goal to embed the dependent Jars.  However, this goal is turned off (by the common parent pom) and just the ordinary maven-jar-plugin is used.  A fix to correct this by turning on the bundle goal, and turning off the jar goal, for just this project, showed up another error: the method of passing in the final build artifact name has a substitutable parameter for the version, which the maven-jar-plugin substitutes, but the maven-bundle-plugin doesn't.  To work around this, don't use the "bundle" goal, go back to using the jar goal, adding a build step that uses maven-dependency-plugin:unpack-dependencies to create the embedding.4) the feature projects (e.g. uimaj-eclipse-feature-tools) specifies the incubator urls, update these to the new locations.5) the code in the update-site project put in to automatically copy the current plugins to the target needs to rename the jars from their maven names to the names that correspond to the eclipse plugin ids and follow Eclipse conventions

texts:Eclipse plugins not working with more recent version of maven-bundle-plugin
With the newer version of maven-bundle-plugin (previous release used 1.4.0, current is 2.1.0, but the parent-pom-eclipse-plugins is using 2.0.1 which was the current version when that pom was made), the generated Manifest is more detailed.  However it is broken - inside the generated MANIFEST.MF, he org.eclipse.core.runtime import is declared now with the additional clause registry=split.This affected several plugins, including in the core, the uimaj-ep-configurator, the uimaj-ep-debug, and uimaj-ep-jcasgen plugins.The result: the update site would build, and would install, however, when attempting to run the plugins, they would fail with class-not-found exceptions.The fix: it would work to go back to 1.4.0.  But a better fix is to change the instructions to handle split packages better: Add the bundle org.eclipse.core.runtime to the Require-Bundle instructions, and add its negation, (!org.eclipse.core.runtime) to the Import-Package instruction, as required by OSGi.While there, check the other negations to insure they are correct.  The Require-Bundle clause takes a bundle-id, which by convention only is often the package name.

texts:improve examples in case where they fail to produce output due to ResultSpecifications
Several times users have been confused when they run example code for the PersonTitle annotator, or the TutorialDateTime annotator, and they see that no results were produced.  This can be due to the passed in Result Specification to the primitive annotator having some specification, and the CAS being processed having an incompatible specification.  For instance, the TutorialDateTime annotator has an output capability specification that says it can produce date time output for CASes having the language "en" or a subset (e.g., "en-us").   If the CAS coming in has no language specified (or is x-unspecified) or is a language which is not a subset of "en" (e.g., pt-br - brazilian portuguese), then that annotator can't produce output.  Sometimes users forget to specify a language, and don't realize this.  To help explain to users what is going on, have the example annotators print out a one-time message to the effect that they are not producing any output due to the result specification, and show the relevant parts of the specification, and the language coming in with the CAS.

texts:ResultSpec behavior incorrect in several cases
Write more test cases examining behavior regarding type/subtype inheritance for both features and types in result specs, and language subsumption testing, using both containsType or containsFeature, with and without intersection.Issues found include: Supertype with allFeatures sets allFeatures for all subtypes.  Correct behavior: specifying allFeatures on a type should only imply allFeatures for features that are known for that type.  Features introduced only in subtypes should not be included. Serialization/deserialization ignores languages other than x-unspecified; it should support the full result-specification.  potential (future?) use case: sending result specs to remote delegates. This was due to a misinterpretation of a javadoc comment.  The getResultTypesAndFeatures() (with no arguments) previously was defined to skip any language tests when retreiving the types and features.  This is quite different from filtering only those with language x-unspecified.  Make sure any rework keeps this behavior.  That being said, the extracted types and features are missing any language information. Assume a feature F introduced in a supertype T.  A result spec T:F should be sufficient to return true for a test of T2:F, where T2 is a subtype ot T (currently returns false). The corner case where a result spec has type T with "allFeats" but type T and/or feature T:F doesn't exist in the type system - containsType("T") or containsFeature("T:F")  should return true.  Needed for backwards compatibility.

Someone uploaded corrupted versions of Eclipse 3.6 artifacts to maven central today, and it broke our builds for things like eclipse plugins, which transitively reference artifacts which are being resolved to the corrupted versions.To work around this and prevent this in the future, lock down all the transitive dependencies (or at least the ones affected now), to versions which "work".

texts:CVD does not warn user about over-writing an existing xmi file
I use the CVD on a weekly basis for inspecting XMI files.  Every so often I select the file menu option "Write XMI CAS File" by accident when I meant to select  "Read XMI CAS File".  Unfortunately, the dialog that comes up when you select either of these options looks exactly the same except for the title which I invariably ignore.  So, I go about navigating to the file I want to open, select it, and then instead of reading it into the CVD it writes out the current contents of the CVD destroying my XMI file.  It would be really nice if it would prompt me asking "this file exists, are you sure you want to overwrite existing file?" - or something to that effect.

texts:UIMA AS Cas Multiplier Not Releasing CASes On Send Failures
UIMA AS Cas Multiplier does not  release a CAS on send failures to a client. The client may have previously terminated while its input CAS was being processed. When the client dies, its temp reply queue is deleted and the Cas Multiplier is unable to deliver CASes. In such case, the Cas Multiplier detects send failure but it does not release a CAS causing eventual hang. The hang may be due to exhausted CAS pool or due to a non-empty cache while processing subsequent CPC request. The CPC is only allowed to be processed if ALL previously sent CASes are processed and the cache becomes empty.

texts:ability to visualize and quickly update/add values to primitive features
I spent a bit of time evaluating the CAS Editor recently and have the following suggestion.  It is common to have annotation tasks in which adding a primitive value to a annotation feature happens frequently.  Here's one common annotation task - part-of-speech tagging.  Usually, the way this task is performed is a part-of-speech tagger is run on some data and a part-of-speech tag is added as a string value to a feature of a token type.  The annotator's task is then to look at the part-of-speech tags and make sure they look right and fix the ones that aren't.  However, the only way to see the part-of-speech tag is by clicking on the token annotation in the text and view the value of the feature in the editor view.  This makes the tool really unusable for this annotation task.  What would be really nice is to be able to display the part-of-speech tags above or below the tokens so that the linguist can scan the sentence with its tags and quickly find the errors.  There are a number of other annotation tasks that have similar requirements.  For example, named entities usually have category labels which would be nice to display.  Word sense disambiguation data is also similar.

texts:It should be possible to open a CAS file from a non Cas Editor project
It should be possible to open a  CAS files which are inside an eclipse java project (and not an eclipse CAS Editor project) with the CAS Editor.After spending more time on the issue the plan how to implement it changed again.The previous idea of having an additional plugin for this functionality is dropped and the change is directlyintegrated into the Cas Editor plugin.There are two changes which must be performed for this issue:1. The Document Provider is extended with a custom logic to open a CAS file from a non Cas Editor Project.Its assumed that the type system is placed in a certain location, if it cannot find in this location theuser if prompted by a dialog to provide a valid type system for the CAS.This mechanism should be improved in the future to play nicely together with all other plugins wich also needaccess to a type system, like the description editors.2.The UI to configure the annotation styles must be moved to the editor and away from the Cas Editor Projecthandling code. To accomplish this the Document Provider should be responsible for accessing/modifyingthe styling information. A new view is added to the editor which can display the styling information and gives access to the annotation property dialog to modify the styling.The styling information is shared between all editors type system wide, if the style is changed in one editorits changed in all other editors which display a CAS with the same type system.The goal of this issue is to create an initial solution which can then be refined by input from users and other uima developers.

texts:UIMA AS detection of missing client reply queue is not working leading to client timeouts
UIMA AS service checks for existence of a reply queue before processing an incoming request. This is done to prevent wasting cycles processing a request if it is known that the client has gone away. Current approach is based on checking broker's queue inventory for presence of a temp reply queue provided in a request msg.  The framework code uses JMX connection to a broker to perform the queue lookup. If the lookup fails, the framework concludes that the client has gone away, places the reply queue in a list of destinations known to be dead and throws away the request msg. Any subsequent msg containing the same reply queue is automatically thrown away since the destination is marked as dead. Occasionally, the JMX lookup fails even though (as reported by some users) the client is alive at the time the lookup was done. It seems that perhaps under load JMX fails, reporting false positive result ( queue not present). The failed lookup results in a dropped request msg and ultimately in a client timeout (or possible hang if the client is not using timout). Modify the implementation to stop using JMX to perform lookups. Instead, before any processing takes place, send a small msg (ACK) back to the client via JMS. If the send fails, report the problem, drop the request and wait for the next request. Also, dont add failed destination to the list of clients known to be dead. Each request should be subject to an ACK no matter what happened previously.The new approach, although generating more jms traffic, has some advantages:1) A client is immediately notified when its request has been picked by a service and is ready to be processed.2) A client "knows" which service is processing each request3) A client can use a different timeout strategy since it knows precisely when its request is ready to be processed.

texts:update trunk poms to depend on -SNAPSHOT versions of build tooling
Implement "3b)" below:Each "release" of the build tooling takes time and effort, from several people,for doing the release, preparing test versions of our code referring to the newrelease, and testing the build tooling, and then doing an svn "merge" of theupdated parent-pom references to pick up the new versions, back into the trunk.I would like to reduce this .  Here's a proposal:Update the current projects in UIMA that use these build tools, to depend onthat previous SNAPSHOT, instead of depending on "released" versions. This will create a "problem" when releasing the projects that use these: projects, when released, cannot depend on snapshots.  To overcome this, at thetime we release, say uimaj-sdk project, do one of the following:3a) Change the build tooling for parent-pom-dist to include a <modules><module>that specifies the uimaj-distr project, and then do the release from theparent-pom-top.  This will release the build tooling, plus all the items inuimaj-distr, together. Downside of this: it introduces a cross SVN-checkout directory dependency,because the <module> must have some kind of relative reference from a "build"checkout (working directory A, say), and the uimaj SDK checkout (workingdirectory B, for instance).  It also requires that, after releasing, we updateparent-pom-distr to remove the <modules> section.3b) When it's time to release, release the build tooling, like we do now, andbefore closing the Nexus staging repo, also release the uimaj-distr projects. Release will complain that there are "still" snapshot poms, but according tohttp://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-583 (which is included in the set ofthings included in the 2.1 version, which we're now using) the release pluginwill let you change these to release levels, as part of the release:prepareprocess.With this approach, we can fiddle the build tooling as much as we need to whilegetting a release to "go", and then release things.

Files copied include the LICENSE/NOTICE, RELEASE_NOTES, README, and some command scripts to manipulate the sources.The custom src file adds a directory Eclipse, which has an Eclipse "launcher"that runs the packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar command.  This might be droppable,because our releases will now have the java sources for each project "attached"in the maven sense, so if m2eclipse is being used, the sources should be fetchedautomatically when needed.The custom src file is also missing the DEPENDENCIES file, and is also missing 2of the 3 aggregate- projects.Do what is needed to make the standard source-release.zip build serve as the source distribution.

Putting these at the top level follows maven conventions, and reduces custom assembly configuration, and makes it work with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1907 using the standard maven sources assembly.The src README was concerned only with building from sources; this is now standardized, and the description is small.The bin README had information that the src build should have had in its readme.  These can be merged.The RELEASE_NOTES contained a summary of what's new/changed etc., plus a hand-copied list of Jira's fixed - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1796 eliminates this requirement, so just point instead to the generated list.Use only the html version of the release notes, drop the .txt version, to reduce release effort.Update the assembly configurations as needed to get these resources from the new places.

texts:merge build tooling artifacts into one, to simplify release process
When build artifacts are updated, releasing can be difficult.  This is because some of the artifacts are dependent on the top parent pom being built, and those artifacts, in turn, depend on the top parent pom (circular refs).  Based on discussion on the mailing list (see http://uima.markmail.org/thread/ryh6voctne6vqb7d ), it would simplify things to collapse all of the build artifacts into just one parent-pom.Do this, making the packaging of that a Jar, and putting into it also the resource bundles needed by the other parent poms.  Change the resource bundle need for assemblies to just plain descriptor references, eliminating the need for bundle refs.  Do what's needed to override the normal source-release assembly, so that our "improved" version is used (it works with flat-hierarchies).Merge all the other parent-poms into one, using either the existence of some file/directory (e.g. src/docbook ) to trigger the particular profile, or, where none can be found, make a new trigger consisting of a file at the top level called something like: "marker-file-identifying-xxxxxx".  Those projects which need these profiles will need to have (empty) files like this to trigger the profile.Use this mechanism instead of pointing to different parent-poms to control the build (as there will now be just one parent pom for all uima projects).Update the projects to use the new parent pom.

texts:releasing with remote-resource-bundle may fail due to version not updating
We configure the remote-resource-plugin to use a customized resource artifact (currently uima-build-resources).  At the moment, the parent-pom configures this plugin with the GAV (groupId, artifactId, and Version) at version 1-SNAPSHOT.When the release happens, the release plugin does not update this configuration parameter to reflect the release version.  (at least, it doesn't when doing release:prepare -DdryRun=true).   So the tag created will have the wrong version (it will have 1-SNAPSHOT, it should be changed to 1).  A workaround is to manually update the tag for this after release:prepare, before doing release:perform.I'm going to ask on maven-user list for the maven way to do this.Finally, there's another bug: the configuration for the remote-release-plugin is pointing to the old location for this and needs to get updated to point to the uima-build-resources artifact.

texts:parent-pom use of dependency + unpack-dependencies inadvertantly affecting children poms
In an attempt to get the release plugin to automatically update the uima-build-resources version number, I had switched the inclusion of the uima-build-resources files from maven-dependency-plugin goal of unpack to unpack-dependencies.  Although this worked for building the parent pom, when run on a ordinary child pom (e.g., the DictionaryAnnotator), the dependencies were the entire set of dependencies merged from the parent pom and the child pom, and the unpack-dependencies unpacked all of them.Since there were other issues with getting the release plugin to automaitcally manage the uima-build-resources version number see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1916 ), fix this by changing back to the unpack goal, specifying just the artifact and files wanted, and remove the <dependencies> spec from the parent-pom to avoid having it merged with all children.

texts:change apache-release build to not do individual project Javadocs for -distr projects
The -distr projects already build Javadocs for the aggregate of the individual modules, but with a filtering of the classes, to show the public APIs.  The default apache-release build (done when the apache-release profile is activated, which it is by default during during release, or if you specify -Papache-release on the mvn command line) builds additionally, Javadocs for everything.   These Javadocs are full of warnings because we haven't been very careful in writing the Javadocs.Building individual Javadocs for every Java module makes the build much slower.  These Javadocs are not included in the distribution, but would be available (if generated) in the Maven repository.  However, the source code is also being generated for each module during release, and that is also available in the with the main artifact in the Maven repository (when finally released).  That has been sufficient for our previous releases.For these reasons, override the apache-release profile for the -distr aggregate projects to remove the Javadoc builds for the -distr projects.

Or, even better, put the top-most pom in the directory that contains all the projects, which is the Maven convention.  Then, you don't need the <relativePath> elements at all, things work by convention.

texts:setting property for common version in parent pom doesn&#39;t work - change to working alternative
The uimaj sdk build factors out the version number for dependencies on other uimaj artifacts.  Having one spot in the parent pom makes this easy to change.  But it doesn't work when it comes time to run the release:prepare step - the attempt to "rewrite" pom versions doesn't handle this case.After some experimentation and googling, I found it will handle having the dependent version come from the common parent pom for uimaj, but just not from a custom property.  Change to this approach:1) still factor out the dependency to the parent, but make it the same as the parent pom's version.2) change the version ref in the child poms to ${project.parent.version}.This approach creates a tie between the normal dependency version for components, and the version of the common parent; since we're probably going to have all the components at the same version level anyways for a while, I don't think this is an issue, for now.

On the next start of the Cas Editor the styles are as before.The code path used to set the annotation styles from the Annotation Styles View fails to serialize the dot corpus file.To fix this issue serialize the dot corpus file.

texts:remove unused dependency on missing activemq artifact
uima-as-distr has a dependency on activemq activeio-core at version 3.0.0-incubator.  This dependency was copied from the 4.1.1 release of activemq, from its top level POM.This version is no longer available.  Googling it shows may other projects have build failures due to its having gone missing.It prevents uima-as-distr from building in a fresh (empty) maven .m2 environment.  Our build doesn't use it, and we will be soon migrating our activeMQ level to a more recent release.  So remove this for now to allow building.

texts:improve eclipse feature projects to have them build ok in Eclipse without errors
The feature.xml file needs to have the version of the feature (spelled using OSGi conventions, not Maven conventions - meaning to use periods, not dashes) injected into the feature.xml from the pom version.  This was being done by using Maven's "filtering" of resources specifying this in the pom in a <resources> element with <filtering> set to true.This worked for building with Maven, but Eclipse builds didn't work - the project shows an "error" because substitutable values aren't allowed in the feature.xml.Fix this by (a) moving the feature.xml to src/main/resources and adding a step to copy it (for Eclipse to see and use) to the top level, with filtering.  Since this is common for all feature projects, add a profile for this in the project-wide common parent, and activate it with a marker-file-identifying-eclipse-feature.(For now, also copy into feature projects until next project-wide pom is released).

texts:XMI Delta CAS Serialization doesn&#39;t work when preexisting FS is indexed in a new View
I think I ran into a problem with XMI delta CAS serialization.  Here's my use case:  I start with a CAS that has a FeatureStructure (not annotation) indexed in the InitialView.  I want to send this to a remote service, wihch will create a new view and add the exisitng FeatureStructure to the indexes of that view.  With delta XMI CAS serialization, this does not seem to work.  The FeatureStructure is not present in the indexes of the new view.Here is a unit test (to be added to XmiCasDeserializerTest.java) that illustrates the problem:  public void testDeltaCasIndexExistingFsInNewView() throws Exception {    CAS cas1 = CasCreationUtils.createCas(typeSystem, new TypePriorities_impl(),            indexes);    CAS cas2 = CasCreationUtils.createCas(typeSystem, new TypePriorities_impl(),            indexes);    cas1.setDocumentText("This is a test document in the initial view");    Type referentType = cas1.getTypeSystem().getType("org.apache.uima.testTypeSystem.Referent");    FeatureStructure fs1 = cas1.createFS(referentType);    cas1.getIndexRepository().addFS(fs1);    //serialize complete      XmiSerializationSharedData sharedData = new XmiSerializationSharedData();    String xml = serialize(cas1, sharedData);    System.out.println(xml);    int maxOutgoingXmiId = sharedData.getMaxXmiId();    //deserialize into cas2    XmiSerializationSharedData sharedData2 = new XmiSerializationSharedData();          this.deserialize(xml, cas2, sharedData2, true, -1);    CasComparer.assertEquals(cas1, cas2);    //create Marker, add/modify fs and serialize in delta xmi format.

Currently external resources for an Analysis Engine can only be loaded from the file system. This is useful for many use cases in which the resources are almost static and rarely change. In our scenario the resourcesare updated frequently and hosted on a central server. The server could expose a file system over the networkvia NFS or windows file sharing, but it seems to be more intuitiv and easier to just distribute the resources via http.In order to do that the resource loading must be extended to also support resource which are available viahttp. It seems that the current code for the file URLs can be easily extended to also allow http resources. According to the documentation it uses URL.openStream and forbids http URLs which would be supportedby that method.

To meet these goals, move the Rat check (not of interest to non-Apache developers) and the build of the binary artifact (and the public api Javadoc) so they are only done if the apache-release profile is specified.  This profile is automatically selected during the release process, and may be manually selected whenever needed (by adding -Papache-release to the mvn command).

UIMA AS aggregate uses a child counter along with a few booleans kept in a cache to determine when to put parent CAS in play. If there are no more child CASes in play and the parent CAS has returned from a CM, the CAS may proceed into a finalStep() or into process() if parentProcessLast=true. Upon return from a CM, the state of the CAS is marked as returned from CM. Problem is it remains set to as returned even though it may be subsequently sent to another delegate CM. When the last child CAS is processed, the parent CAS is released even though it may still be in a CM delegate. The fix for this is to reset "return from delegate" flag to false before dispatching a CAS to the next delegate in a flow.

When the compiler warnings are set to complain when name shadowing or name conflicts exist, then the source files produced by JCasGen contain many warnings.

Eclipse does not seem to allow for fine grained compiler warning configuration (i.e. to ignore certain warnings for certain source folders or packages) but only works at the project level.    Therefore, I must either turn these warnings off for the entire project or must ignore the warnings in the type system java files.

The method addFeature(...) on TypeSystemImpl, when the boolean multipleReferencesAllowed is not specified as an argument, default this to "true".The method addFeature(...) on an instance of TypeDescriptionImpl, when multipleReferencesAllowed is not specified as an argument, default this to "null".CasCreationUtils mergeFeatures(...) throws a ResourceInitializationException saying INCOMPATIBLE_MULTI_REFS if a feature is has multipleReferencesAllowed as true in one, and "null" in the other.  The comment in the code says that "false" is the default.The use case driving this is reported in  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/uima-user/201101.mbox/%3C267885741.1859849.1296090121503.JavaMail.root@sz0143a.emeryville.ca.mail.comcast.net%3E.There are multiple ways to fix this. The actual type stores the value of multipleReferencesAllowed as a "boolean", so "null" is not an option. So, we can't change the value of the multipleReferencesAllowed default to match what happens in TypeDescriptionImpl, namely, to set the value to "null".Try changing the merge code to allow merging if the feature is not an array or a List (because multipleReferencesAllowed is only used for those cases).  Or, change callers of the addFeature(...) in TypeSystemImpl to explicitly set the multipleReferencesAllowed to false if the range cannot be a list element or an array.

texts:UIMA AS process does not terminate reliably
UIMA AS two stop options dont seem to work reliably. Neither 's' nor 'q' on the command line force a clean shutdown of the process. Actually, there is also a related problem. Namely, when the shutdown succeeds it appears that the Shared Connection that all Spring listeners use is not closed which leads to an ugly exception on the broker console. This happens every time the service is terminated. Review listeners shutdown code and make sure that when the last listener terminates the connection is stopped before the process exits. Also, make sure that uima threads from custom pools are daemon threads to allow the jvm to collect them on shutdown. NOTE: AMQ version 4.x internal threads are not daemon threads and there is special code in the listener to wait for them to stop before exiting. Newer AMQ version use daemon threads so shutting down AMQ is much more reliable.

texts:Solrcas should be fail-fast if type system mapping is incompatible
The SolrCASConsumer does not check if the specified types in the mapping file are actually compatible with the provided type system. Depending on the mapping and the processed CASes it might fail or cause incorrectly indexed data. In both cases the problem might be hard to diagnose when it also depends on the data in the CAS, e.g. it only fails if a FS of a certain type is present.During initialization the compatibility should be checked and in case of a problem fail with a meaningful error message.

texts:Solrcas should remove CAS.toString() to field mapping aka "CasMapping"
Solrcas has a feature to map CAS.toString to a field in Solr. CAS.toString return the memory address of the CAS obejct, which in most contexts does not has any meaning to a user. This mapping should be removed since users might easily assume it could be used as an unique id which it cannot. There is also no reason to index the CAS memory address.If a user wishes to index debugging information it should be added as FSes to the CAS and indexed. The functionality to do that is already present via type to field mappings.

All instances of sync aggregates share Resource Manager containing common CasManager. Unable to reproduce this problem on Linux, Windows or Mac. Further diagnosis points toward an issue with the UIMA Java SDK, for use cases where multiple instances of an aggregate (containing a Cas Multiplier) are created and run using a shared common UIMA Context / Resource Manager.  Several parts of the Resource Manager are not thread safe.  Figure out where things like getEmptyCas need to be synchronized.Come up with a better test case (that isn't so intermittent).

The extended tests, the testDeployAgainAndAgain occasionally fails.  The failure occurs in the following sequence:The test starts, it deploys some services, these connect to the broker.  It deploys a client, this client sets up a connection to the broker, and creates a temp queue, and then immediately sends a getMeta request using the just created temp queue as the reply destination.  The service gets the getMeta, and responds, by attempting to send the reply to that temp queue.But the Broker hasn't (apparently) quite finished create the queue, and so we get a message to the console log saying:javax.jms.InvalidDestinationException: Cannot publish to a deleted Destination: temp-queue:// ...The error is quite intermittent.  Sometimes there is no error reported for this testDeployAgainAndAgain.  However, if I put that test into a loop, it seems to fail somewhere between 200 - 300 seconds of running on the MacBook.  If I insert a 1/10 second delay after the Client creates the temp queue on the broker, and before the Client uses that temp queue in a getMeta request, then it runs for hours with no error being reported.Suggestion: insert a short delay after first setting up a temp queue in a broker, before using that queue in messages, to insure it has a chance to get set up.  Consider making a test case for this for ActiveMQ.

This is because the implementation of FeatureStructure.equals checks that the FS are both pointing to the same CAS object.  But the CAS reference of an FS is currently being set to whichever view that FS was created off of.  So if you obtain a reference to an FS through two different views, equals() will always return false because the CAS references don't match.

The solution is to wrap these things in code that looks like this from the XTalkTransporter (this assumes the file length is known):  static public void readFully(byte[] b, int length, InputStream in) throws IOException {    int read_so_far = 0;    while (read_so_far < length) {      int count = in.read(b, read_so_far, length - read_so_far);      if (count < 0) {        throw new EOFException();      }      read_so_far += count;    }  }Code which is broken can be found by scanning for .read(Ones I found scanning are:VinciTAEClientFileUtils (copyFile method) (Note: similarly named class FileUtil (no final "s") has a copyFile method that is OK)XMLUtil.java has fragment that could fail incorrectly in detectXmlFileEncoding:      // store the 1st text byte and read next 6 bytes of XML file      buffer&#91;byteCounter++&#93; = (byte) nextByte;      if (iStream.read(buffer, byteCounter, bytes2put - 1) != bytes2put - 1)   //ERROR NOT ALLOWING FOR FEWER BYTES READ        throw new IOException("cannot read file");There are multiple instances of code in JcasSofaTest don't allow for the possiblity of reading fewer than buf size; here's one:      dest = new byte&#91;4&#93;;      is.close();      is = intArrayView.getSofaDataStream();      assertTrue(is != null);      int i = 0;      while (is.read(dest) != -1) {        assertTrue(ByteBuffer.wrap(dest).getInt() == intArrayFS.get(i++));        ;      }And another one like this in SofaTest.DebugControlThread method doCheckpoint has the problemIn our examples, the following have the problem:CasMultiplierExampleApplication FileSystemCollectionReaderExampleApplicationPrintAnnotationsJetExpanderAnd in uimaj-tools:FileSystemCollectionReaderCasTreeViewer

texts:Add eclipse launch support for Analysis Engines
Developing/testing AEs inside eclipse is cumbersome because we do nothave launch support for AEs. To run an AE inside eclipse a small helperclass must be created which can instantiate the AE, supply it with CASesand maybe serialize the processed CASes again.To ease up this process we should have launch support which is capable ofinstantiating an AE (or AAE), supply it with CASes and then serialize the CASesagain. The launch support should also be able to run PEARS.

texts:CasToInlineXml adds whitespace
CasToInlineXml adds indentation between adjacent XML elements. E.g. for a single character document with a single annotation covering that one character, it will write:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><Document>    <uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation sofa="Sofa" begin="0" end="1" language="x-unspecified">        <uima.tcas.Annotation sofa="Sofa" begin="0" end="1"> </uima.tcas.Annotation>    </uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation></Document>I think it should instead write everything in a single line, that is:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><Document><uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation sofa="Sofa" begin="0" end="1" language="x-unspecified"><uima.tcas.Annotation sofa="Sofa" begin="0" end="1"> </uima.tcas.Annotation></uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation></Document>I believe this could be fixed by replacing the line:XMLSerializer sax2xml = new XMLSerializer(byteArrayOutputStream);with the line:XMLSerializer sax2xml = new XMLSerializer(byteArrayOutputStream, false);I think it's a bug that CasToInlineXml is changing the character offsets, but I would also be happy if there was an alternate constructor or a method on CasToInlineXml that allowed disabling the formatting.

I wanted to extend the ResourceManager_impl in an effort to explore the injection of POJOs into UIMA components. This effort was complicated a bit because the class ResourceManager_impl.ResourceRegistration is package private. For people who want to implement their own version of a ResourceManager, I suppose it would be helpful if that class was protected instead, so subclasses can properly work with the mInternalResourceRegistrationMap field, which is also protected.

texts:UIMA AS Aggregate Not Handling Broker Restart
UIMA AS aggregate with remote delegate is not recovering correctly when a broker is stopped and subsequently restarted. In this scenario, both the aggregate and the delegate reconnect to the new broker, which is expected. The problem is that the aggregate is not creating a new temp queue and corresponding listener for the remote delegate. The aggregate actually creates the temp queue and a listener if and only if maxRetries>0 in the delegate's error handling configuration. The recovery should be done regardless of the this setting. After broker restart, the subsequent CAS coming in to the aggregate should force creation of a temp reply queue and a new listener on that queue before the CAS is sent to a remote delegate.

texts:Turn the HMMTagger class into a more generic class for tagging tasks
Despite its name, the code of the org.apache.uima.examples.tagger.HMMTagger class is not totally independant from the pos tagging task. In addition it assumes that the feature path to update with the result of the tagging is org.apache.uima.TokenAnnotation:posTag.We propose to let the possibility to users to specify by parameter the feature path to set. This parameter is optional. If it is left free, the tagger will work as usually using the org.apache.uima.TokenAnnotation:posTag as default value.By the way, we propose to add three optional parameters : InputView, SentenceType and ModelFile.Since the HMM Learner has got the possibility to specify the view to use to train a model, we consequently decide to give the same possibility for the tagger. By default, it works on the _InitialView. It is actually quite useful in practice!The org.apache.uima.TokenAnnotation type is not the only annotation type which is assumed to be present in the CAS. Actually, the HMMTagger processes tokens sentence by sentence. It uses the   org.apache.uima.SentenceAnnotation to select the tokens. The SentenceType parameter aims at letting the users free to specify their own sentence annotation Type. The default value is org.apache.uima.SentenceAnnotation. The ModelFile parameter is a concurrent way to the resource declaration way to specify a model.Left empty, it won t be considered. Otherwise it will predomine over the resource declaration. When specified, the multiple deployement of the tagger cannot be allowed but in practice for the user it may be easier to configure a parameter through Eclipse.    Two distincts patches will be provided, one for the class and the other for the descriptor.Future improvement of the class might offer the possibility to create new annotations not only to update existing ones.  Future improvement of the descriptor may dissociate what it is up to the tagger and what it is relevant for the pos tagger...

Reads the dotCorpus file and sets the type system location for the project2. Copies the dotCorpus to the new default styling file locationAfter these two steps a user will be able to open any .xcas or .xmi file insidethe migrated project with the configured styling.

texts:Update of the Lucene libraries to version 2.9.3. Addition of an attribute for field definitions in the mapping file to make this field unique in the resulting index.
The Lucene library dependency has been updated to version 2.9.3. Thus, some classes had to be rewritten using the new Lucene Token API. Not all classes have been adapted to the new API, however, so that the component is not yet Lucene 3.x compliant.Lucas creates multiple Field instances for each field declared in the mapping file which is to be stored as well as indexed. This is done even when not necessary. As this may collide with a unique-key property (e.g. in Solr) a new attribute "unique" has been added to the field element of the mapping file. If the value of this attribute is set to "true" and there is only one declaration for this field name in the mapping file, there will be created only one field instance.This addition has been added to the project's docbook (along with quite some spelling corrections, a few reformulations and corrections to the examples).

texts:DocumentAnalyzer/RunAE tools don&#39;t support XML detagging and Remote Vinci AEs
It generates invalid XCASes as output if you try to do this.  This is because Sofa mapping is used to do XML detagging, but Sofa mapping isn't implemented correctly for Vinci services (in fact it seems completely broken now).  Anyway it is slated to be completely removed for v2.1 (see UIMA-122).It may be possible to do Sofa mapping differently so that the detagged text is stored in the _InitialView, so that Sofa mapping isn't needed for the remote.  Failing that, we'd just need to put in a better error message until such time as we implement Sofa mapping for remotes in a reliable way.

texts:Tagger build dependency on Whitespace Tokenizer causes failure for mvn commands which don&#39;t build the jar
Note: This probably should be fixed after the 2.3.1addons release.The Tagger has a dependency on the Whitespace Tokenizer addon component, at the same release level (currently).This means that if you check out the source, and then do a "mvn test", you get a failure, because  although Maven correctly orders things so that the build of the WhitespaceTokenizer happens first because the Maven command is "mvn test", no jar file is built and the Tagger tests fail because they are depending on the Jar being built.The workaround is to run mvn install once, so the right level of the WhitespaceTokenizer is in the local .m2 repo.The fix could be to change the dependency of the WhitespaceTokenizer to a previous (could be unchanging) release, e.g. the 2.3.0 level.  Of course, that can't be done yet, because we haven't released the add-ons to Maven Central (yet) - the last release was to the special repo for incubating projects.My feeling is to leave this as an issue for the 2.3.1 release, and fix it for the next release by depending on the released 2.3.1 version of the WhitespaceTokenizer.

The Annotation Editor displays the text which a user can annotate. To annotate a piece of text a user needs to select the text and then use one of the two annotate actions. There are various ways of selecting the text and users usually just mix them as it fits their need.It turned our when a piece of text is selected by mouse-movement (press left mosue button, move, release)the mode annotate action does not create an annotation.

This way a new user will find out that the color changes depending on the curser position rather quickly.

Current UIMA AS code doesnt extract CAS per component performance breakdown from UIMA aggregate. Such breakdown would be very useful in identifying bottlenecks in a pipeline. This breakdown is available via AnalysisEngine's getManagementInterface(). The API accesses the same performance stats that AE exposes via JMX. Since these stats are cumulative, the UIMA AS code should calculate delta to obtain per CAS performance breakdown. Before calling processAndOutputNewCASes(), the code should make a copy (actually a deep copy) of AnalysisEngineManagement instance(s) and calculate delta (of analysisTime) before returning input CAS.The list containing the breakdown should be serialized into a reply message and de-serialized by the client. The UIMA AS client will provide an application the breakdown as a List via a callback method on UimaAsBaseCallbackListener.

An example:  The BSF Annotator, when packaged not as an OSGi bundle, is packaged as both a single Jar, with only the BSF Annotator code itself, and also as a PEAR file, containing that Jar plus the dependent Jars it needs to run.  The PEAR file has a License/Notice that includes the information needed because of distributing the dependent Jars it needs.  The basic Jar file, containing only the Apache-produced code, has the LICENSE/NOTICE files without this other information - this seems correct to me.The OSGi packaging is distributing the other Jars, so it needs the augmented version of the LICENSE/NOTICE files.  If any OSGi packagings have additional Jars, beyond what is included in the non-OSGi packaging, the License/Notice files for those need to be potentially augmeneted, also.

texts:web page display of (TM) trademark not working
While updating the web pages, I noticed that the symbol that used to display as a small TM (for trademark) wasn't displaying correctly. I fooled around with several alternatives, but couldn't get this resolved.I did determine that if the trademark is coded as & # 0 1 5 3;  (with no spaces - here it is with no spaces, which this Jira displays as the TM symbol: &#0153; ), then our Anakia transform transforms this into hex 99 in the xxx.html generated page, which, displays OK in a browsers.  If however, you upload load this to Apache, and view the page from there, it displays incorrectly.In firefox/chrome, if you download the Apache page as "html page only" mode, then you can display that ok locally, again.  But if you download the Apache page as "web page complete" - some kind of transformation happens, including changing the charset= from iso-8859-1 to utf-8, and then the bad display happens.  If I manually change that charset back to iso-8859-1, the tm appears again.  I'm stuck at the moment to understand what is going on, or how to fix.

texts:CasDocumentProvider should be suitable for any kind of ICasEditor
The Cas Editor is build around the idea that a Document Provider is responsible to manage CASes for various ICasEditor implementations. The CAS handling itself should be independent of their content, therefore a CAS which contains a text view can be managed (created, serialized, delted) in the same way as a CAS which contains an audio view.Currently the CasDocumentProvider extends the eclipse text Document Provider, this inheritance should be removed, and the CasDocumentProvider should be independent of the text Document Provider.

texts:Reusing of ICasEditor instances doesn&#39;t surrounding update views
If the amount of editor in the workbench is restricted to a certain number, eclipse will reuse already existing editors and sets a new input.In the case an editor input is change all the ICasEditor sensitive views are still bound to the old editor input.The AnnotationEditor can be reused by the eclipse workbench, and also view switches can change the way an input CAS is displayed.The AnnotationEditor itself can deal with any type of CAS sofa, if it is a text it is displayed and if not an appropriate message page is displayed. The surrounding views don't have a mechanism to deal with changing editor input or changing CAS views.Therefore we should extend the page book style annotation editor views with a mechanism to have an additional layer of pages to cover the following cases:a) Show view implementation and cas contents (Maybe destroy it and re-create, reusable viewpages are error prone to implement)b) View cannot be displayed because the document is not available (document failed to load)c) View cannot be displayed because the CAS view is incompatible with this view

To enable running services on a simulated node (not physical one), the UIMA AS needs to fetch the IP address from a System environment which will be configured by an application launching the AS service.

texts:UIMA AS doesn&#39;t expose CAS instance in onBeforeMessageSend() callback
UIMA AS client sendAndReceive() blocks a thread until either a reply is received or there is a timeout. If an application uses multiple threads each blocked in sendAndReceive(), there is no way for an application to correlate onBeforeMessageSend() and onBeforeProcessCAS() callbacks to a specific CAS. The callbacks only expose cas reference Id, which (in this scenario) does not help since the cas reference id is only available when sendAndReceive() returns. Modify UIMA AS to expose CAS instance when calling onBeforeMessageSend() and onBeforeProcessCAS(). The CAS will be available via a new getCAS() method defined in UimaASProcessStatus which is an argument in both callbacks.

Many settings in the Cas Editor need to be saved in a type system scope. This is for example the configuration of annotation styling, annotation key bindings, etc.Plugins which extend the Cas Editor have the same requirement, but the Cas Editor does not support writing of preferences to the existing DotCorpus file, which is saving preferences per type system.To fix this  replace the existing DotCorpus file with an eclipse preference store. This preference stoer can then also be used by plugins to save type system scoped settings.Existing DotCorpus files must be migrated to the preference store. This should be done in a similar way as the migration of Cas Editor projects is done. A popup dialog ask the user if he wants to migrate.

texts:CDE operating very slowly with IBM Java
Opening a large set of descriptors in the Configuration Descriptor Editor (CDE) is very slow using IBM Java.  Investigation reveals that some caching put in to speed up Java Bean introspection was being done on a per-instance-of-a class basis, instead of on a class basis.  The IBM Java appears to create and link a brand-new method.invoke piece of code for each of these instances, which slows down the reflection access approach used by XML parsing and descriptor cloning, considerably. Sun Java doesn't seem sensitive to this; they must have some different approach to reflective method invocation.Fix this by changing the way Introspection results are cached in MetaDataObject_impl to cache Introspection results just once per Class, instead of once per class instance.  This speeds up things by 3x overall (I measured it) in time-to-load a large descriptor into the CDE, and more-or-less matches what Sun Java achieves.

texts:Let CAS Editor implement IResourceChangeListener
Some functionality to automatically update a opened CAS in the CAS editor if the file was changed would be really nice. I don't know for sure, if this functionality is missing or I simply didn't find it in the code and in Eclipse. In any case, I haven't found a IResourceChangeListener implementation and that is how I would have done it.The general communication shouldn't be a problem to implement, but - in my experience - updating all necessary elements can be tricky. The interface for changing a view can maybe be used and has probably to be extended.

texts:docbook builds intermittently fail with with duplicate ID error, detected by FOP (PDF build) processing
The docbkx process runs an xslt transformation over the source to produce a .fo input file for FOP to produce the PDF.  From time to time, this transformation will generate xml <fo:block id="dxxxx"> elements, with identical "id"s, which FOP then checks for and stops running when it finds one (duplicate ids are illegal in xml). These ids appear not to be used.  I looked through one file - the UIMA tools guide, and didn't see any use.The problem is intermittent, and may be related to multi-core machines.  On my latest laptop (which has 4 real cores), I'm often getting this error.  Rerunning a few times usually gets me around this.  I can increase the likelihood that rerunning works, by kicking off some other CPU-intensive work on my laptop, while the xslt transformation is going onThese generated <fo:block id="dxxx"> elements with duplicate ids always appear around the embedding of external graphics.  Fix this by finding the place in the xslt transform templates which generate this, and remove the id=... part; add this as a customization override template to our docbook process.

Anakia has the ability to generate output in various codepage encodings.  This is controlled by a mostly undocumented setting in the properties, with the name output.encoding.

Apache webservers are set to output pages assuming they are UTF-8 encoded, so Anakia must be told to output using UTF-8.Fix this by1) adding a velocity.properties file where the other velocity control files live, namely, in xdocs/stylesheets2) fix the anakia call in the build.xml to use this style sheet, and also fix a bug where the style= setting is incorrect.3) change the character encoding on team-list.xml (source) to be utf-8.

When AE throws an exception UIMA wraps it in AnalysisEngineProcessException which is handed off to UIMA AS.

The client deserializes the cargo back to a java Exception and hands it off to the application via a callback. The problem is that the Exception stack trace may include user defined Exception class(es) which are not available to the client thus causing ClassNotFound while deserializing a reply. Modify UIMA AS service side to serialize an exception to a String and send that to the client.

texts:Define automatic distribution of a closed term set over multiple fields in one field definition.
In the course of my work I needed LuCas to do a few things which were not possible or at least not too easy out-of-the-box. I checked out the latest LuCas version and adapted it to suit my needs.The main extension arose from the following idea:In the documents I want to index, gene names and identifiers are tagged (into a UIMA type 'Gene'). These identifiers are indexed so you can search for them. For faceting purposes I send these identifiers into a Lucene field named 'facetTerms'. However, I have quite a whole lot of identifiers AND the identifiers are organized in multiple categories in my application. The best thing for me would be to have a single field for each of these categories, containing only gene identifiers belonging to this category.This allows to easily obtain facet counts per category.Now I have over 20 categories and I did not like the idea of a LuCas mapping file with 20 copies of nearly the same field definition.So I allowed new attributes to a field element in the mapping file. These attributes would specify: A file determining the association between each possible term and its category (same format as hypernym file, so one term can belong to multiple categories); The naming scheme of the new fields; Whether to ignore the case when comparing the entries of the above mentioned file to the actual terms extracted from documents.I wrote a class which realizes the distribution of the terms to their categories by creating the corresponding TokenStreams. Each TokenStream is supposed to let only those tokens pass which belong to its category. These tokens are determined by the association file described above. Thus we need the opposite of a StopWordFilter. I've added the 'SelectFilter' for this purpose. This filter mainly takes a set representing a closed vocabulary and lets tokens pass which are included in the set and denies other tokens (here comes the ignore option into play).Another thing I did was to implement a RegExp replacement filter - it simply matches token string against a regular expression. On match the token string is replaced by a given replacement string (may include reg exp replacement characters like &).Please note that the delivered patch file is not complete in terms of documentation, file headers etc. I would add these things if the changes are accepted.

This means, that the types system the leanrer is based on needs to be extended in the background by the framework.

texts:UIMA AS aggregate fetches too many msgs from its service queue
In this scenario UIMA AS aggregate thread receives a msg from a service queue, desarializes a CAS, fetches the next step from the FC, and deliveres the CAS to a delegate's queue. Once the CAS is delivered to the delegate's queue, the receiving thread is done and proceeds to fetch another msg from a service queue. This is wrong and totaly breaks prefetch=0 idea and effects load balancing if there are multiple instances of UIMA AS aggregate. The receiving thread should not fetch another msg while the previous CAS is still in-play. The code should block the receiving thread after a CAS is delivered to a delegate's queue until the CAS is fully processed.

texts:Update UIMA AS documentation to say that continue on error is a supported action for colocated delegates
UIMA AS documentation states that continue on failure action is not allowed when specifying error handling for colocated delegate. This restriction was motivated by the fact that when a CAS processing fails in a colocated delegate, that CAS integrity may be compromised and such CAS should not be used for analysis by downstream annotators. Although this may be true, what to do with the CAS should be left up to the user's FC. The UIMA AS code actually supports continue on error for colocated delegates and the documentation should change to say that it is a valid choice.Also, DDE GUI should change to enable continue on error as a valid choice.

texts:UIMA AS should add a global UncaughtExceptionHandler
Currently UIMA AS process doesnt handle uncaught exceptions. Specifically, it should catch OOM Error and exit the process. When the OOM happens now, the jvm dumps an error (stack trace) and the UIMA AS process just hangs. Since JDK 1.5, java supports per thread as well a system wide (for all threads) custom UncaughtExceptionHandler. The application implements this interface and injects the handler to a specific thread via:Thread.currentThread().setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MyExceptionHandler());Alternatively, one can set a global error handler via:Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(new MyExceptionHandler());The latter is the approach that I will implement. When OOM Error happens (and perhaps for all errors), the UIMA AS process should exit. For all other exceptions (not caught in a executing thread), the custom exception handler will simply log the exception at WARNING level.

texts:Need reliable way to download uima binary artifact from standard Apache spot
The uima-as build is somewhat broken.  A fix was made to download the base uimaj sdk binary build (upon which the uima-as build depends) by adding a new goal to the uima-build-helper-maven-plugin.  That goal has a small bug - it doesn't create the intermediate directories needed when creating the output file for the download.However, it has a bigger problem - the download runs a small loop, reading from the URL open stream, and writing to the local file.  The loop ends when the read method returns -1 for the number of bytes read.  Java is supposed to only return this when the end-of-file is reached, but (randomly) it is getting returned early.  This results in a corrupt download, with only the first part of the file being downloaded.Investigate and fix.

texts:Log methods for log wrappers
The logging framework of UIMA provides wrappers for several logging backends, e.g. for Log4J and JSR47. These frameworks provide special logging methods for logger wrappers that make sure the final logging message contains the correct logging location information (e.g. filename, class, line, etc.). The UIMA Logger interface does not provide such a generic logging method and is, thus, not suitable to be wrapped itself.Wrapping a Logger instance can be interesting for building complex logging message with helper methods, or, to provide an alternative logging API. Recently, uimaFIT 1.3.0 has introduced a more convenient logging API wrapping the UIMA Logger. Unfortunately, currently the class name written to the log is always the name of the logger wrapper, not of the original caller.

The getSofa method is thus defined:  public SofaFS getSofa() {    if (AnnotationBase_Type.featOkTst && ((AnnotationBase_Type) jcasType).casFeat_sofa == null)      this.jcasType.jcas.throwFeatMissing("sofa", "uima.tcas.Annotation");    return (SofaFS) jcasType.ll_cas.ll_getFSForRef(            jcasType.ll_cas.ll_getRefValue(addr, ((AnnotationBase_Type)jcasType).casFeatCode_sofa));  }It seems the missing feature exception should have "uima.tcas.AnnotationBase". If this is correct then a comment might be warranted.

texts:Improve XmiCasDeserializer performance
I profiled an expensive CAS deserialization and found that 46% of the time was in CASImpl.ll_getFSForRef (the method that creates a FeatureStructure Java object for a CAS FS).  All those calls were coming from deserializing arrays (of which this particular CAS has many).It is unnecessary to create FeatureStructure Java objects here.  For non-array FSs, XmiCasDeserializer uses low-level CAS APIs in order to avoid this overhead.  But for arrays, it currently does not use the low-level APIs.

texts:Can our own inhouse headings management tool for entity extraction?
The company I work at is looking at UIMA as a potential environment to use for automated indexing/entity extraction. We have our own application that does headings management. I see the number of annotators that UIMA has as well as adding analysis engines. Could we either directly or indirectly use our tool with UIMA? Our tool would have subject headings to search on the document. Much appreciation for feedback on this. Burt BuchmanSolutions Architect Ebsco Publishingbbuchman@ebscohost.com

An example of a problem which happens if this is not done: the descriptors that come with the UIMA toolkit have a comment that specifies the license information for that file. If you edit a descriptor containing such a comment with the CDE, it strips out all comments.An alternative for license info: add a new, optional element to the descriptor for specifying the license (but this might  be ambigious as to what is being licensed - the descriptor file or what it refers to or ??? )

texts:Uima type merging for string subtypes not working
The basic situation is that we are providing a UIMA-based core that other teams can extend to suit their needs.  As such we are making use of UIMA type merging to allow them to add new features to existing types.  This approach works fine since JCasGen merges the two definitions of the given type and produces a superset of the features.  This is well documented here:http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.3.1/references.html#ugr.ref.jcas.merging_types.jcasgen_support However, in addition to this, we have the case where we have a string subtype with given allowedValues - lets say values a, b and c.  The other team wants to extend this type and have additional allowedValues, say value d.  Ideally, what I would like to do is the following (which follows the pattern used for adding features):Type Definition #1 (provided by core):    <typeDescription>      <name>com.ibm.Type</name>      <description></description>      <supertypeName>uima.cas.String</supertypeName>      <allowedValues>        <value>          <string>a</string>          <description></description>        </value>        <value>          <string>b</string>          <description></description>        </value>        <value>          <string>c</string>          <description></description>        </value>      </allowedValues>    </typeDescription>     Type Definition #2 (extension to core):    <typeDescription>      <name>com.ibm.Type</name>      <description></description>      <supertypeName>uima.cas.String</supertypeName>      <allowedValues>        <value>          <string>d</string>          <description></description>        </value>      </allowedValues>    </typeDescription>In this case I wanted UIMA to recognize the two definitions at runtime and allow the superset of allowedValues.  However, this does not do the trick - at runtime UIMA throws an exception saying that value d is not an allowed value for com.ibm.Type.

texts:UIMA-AS CAS multiplier hangs fetching empty CAS after client timeouts
I'm attaching a test case that reproduces the hang. See the README inside the zip about how to execute it.The annotator (ForwardJCas) consists of a simple CAS multiplier with delays in it scaled out in its own thread within 2 levels of aggregates. It receives a CAS, sleeps for 3 seconds, gets a new empty CAS, copies information into it, sleeps again, and then returns the CAS. The unit test (UimaAsTest) initializes 40 UIMA-AS clients with a timeout of 8 seconds, send 1 CAS from each to the service, and then waits. After 1-2 runs, the CAS multiplier winds up hanging on the getEmptyCas() call in the scaled out annotator. What appears to be happening is that free CAS messages are not being sent from the client to the service in all cases when the timeouts occur. A similar defect (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1786) was fixed in 2.3.1 with slightly different symptoms.

The latter is specified via -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=xxx property. If omitted, UIMA AS service wrapper just proceeds as if the jmx monitor was not requested by a user. Modify code to log a message indicating that the jmx port is missing and exit the process.

texts:UIMA AS client not handling GetMeta Ping timeout correctly
The uima-as client marks a service as unavailable when it detects a timeout on a CAS. A subsequent CAS (submitted by an application) is be added to a Pending Dispatch list and the uima-as client sends a GetMeta ping request to a service to check if it is alive. While the client awaits response, any additional CAS submitted by an application is added to the Pending Dispatch List. When the service responds to the GetMeta ping all CASes from a Pending Dispatch list are dispatched to the service. When the service does not respond to the GetMeta ping, the uima-as client fails to reject CASes sitting in the Pending Dispatch list. This may cause a hang if the application draws CASes from a Cas Pool. The client should throw a timeout exception on all CASes in the PendingDispatch list on GetMeta ping timeout

texts:BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl does not protect access to SharedConnection in a multi-instance, multi-threaded scenario. Possible javax.jms.IllegalStateException.
We see this problem sporadically when running one instance of BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl per Thread. This means that each request Thread will instantiate its own instance of BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl to submit a CAS async. We have noticed in our logs the following exception:org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.client.BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl WARN  2012-05-04 00:10:46,710 &#91;BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.803&#93; - Top Level Controller Initialization Exception.javax.jms.IllegalStateException: The Session is closed at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.checkClosed(ActiveMQSession.java:722) at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.createConsumer(ActiveMQSession.java:1101) at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.createConsumer(ActiveMQSession.java:1060) at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.createConsumer(ActiveMQSession.java:973) at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.createConsumer(ActiveMQSession.java:946) at org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.client.BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.initializeConsumer(BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.java:523) at org.apache.uima.adapter.jms.client.BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.initialize(BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.java:687)Under further inspection, it seems that the BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.initialize does not properly protects the access to the SharedConnection object. Given the following scenario:Thread 1 is in the middle of a call to UimaAsynchronousEngine.initialize.Thread 2 is finishing up and calling UimaAsynchronousEngine.stop.Thread 1 can be schedule out just before trying to create a Consumer (BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.java:523). Thread 2 will call stop() and due to client count, cause the Connection to get closed. When Thread 1 comes back, the Connection and Session instances that it has reference to are now invalid.I've attached a test case that forces the exception to prove that there is no proper mutex around access to the SharedConnection between initialize and stop. I believe that the code in question is in BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl.initialize between lines 682 and 700.createSharedConnection(brokerURI);synchronized (connectionMux) {        // Reuse existing JMS connection if available        if (sharedConnection != null) {          initializeProducer(brokerURI, endpoint, sharedConnection.getConnection());          initializeConsumer(brokerURI, sharedConnection.getConnection());        } else {          initializeProducer(brokerURI, endpoint);          initializeConsumer(brokerURI);        }        // Increment number of client instances. SharedConnection object is a static        // and is used to share a single JMS connection. The connection is closed        // when the last client finishes processing and calls stop().        if (sharedConnection != null) {          sharedConnection.registerClient(this);        }}That entire block should be protected with the sharedConnectionSemaphore.

texts:better xml formatting when serializing
Improve the indenting done when serializing xml.  It should handle a mixed case, where some indenting comes from deserializing the XML in the preserve-comments-and-whitespace mode (which was recently added), and other indenting is "computed" for parts of the object which do not have existing DOM nodes (because, for instance, they were programmatically added, as opposed to being created via a deserialization process).Also, fix the wizards that create the initial "blank" versions to properly indent the templates they produce.

texts:Feature structure removal from sorted index is very slow
Removal of feature structures from sorted indexes (e.g. default index) is very slow. FSIntArrayIndex.remove() method performs two operations: linear search in the array until the given FS is found, followed by the shift of elements to the end of this array by one position to the left.If many annotations (millions and more) are being deleted at once, this operation gets very very slow - much slower than adding these annotations in the first place. It seems to require O(N^2) time to remove N annotations.One item is the linear search, which can be replaced by the binary search method, which is already implemented in the same class.Second, array copy can be done with Java built-in method instead of a custom loop.Ideally, a method for bulk removal of a collection of annotations would have been the most efficient, for example a method to remove all annotations of a given type.

TextMarker rules are only able to test on the exact values of features. Especially for string features, a more flexible way to compare or test string values (e.g., with regular expressions) is desirable. This functionality can easily be added if the REGEXP condition also works on string variables instead of only for the matched text.

It returns a shorter annotation before longer. That is why the sequence 'aText bText cText' will be matched and sequence 'aText bText cText cMoreText' will not because it will be considered later and will not pass NOT PARTOF condition.I've revealed this after migration to the latest TextMarker sources (from ASF repo). Before we used the one from Sourceforge.net. In the old (sourceforge) version this problem did not arise because TextMarkerBasic could keep only one annotation per Type as 'begin anchor'. Returning to the example this means that 'cText' TextMarkerBasic held only one C annotation as begin anchor.In current (rev. 1371274) version TextMarkerBasic keeps a set of begin and end anchors per Type. This is actually a good improvement.But I suggest to make ordering of anchored annotations returned by TextMarkerRuleElement#getNextAnnotations(boolean, AnnotationFS, TextMarkerStream) method more controllable.E.g., by adding some parameter for TextMarkerEngine or script which will define AnnotationComparator#compare implementation.Also returning longer annotations before shorter ones seems to be more compliant to the UIMA default indexing.

texts:Binary deserialization inefficient
The CAS binary deserialization code can be made (much) more space efficient.  Currently, the char data that is used in the strings is read into a char array; each string is represented as an offset into this char array + a length; and new Java strings are created using new String(chararray, offset, length).  This works, but it allocates a new char array for each string being created, and copies from the original char array.  This results in new char array objects for each string object.The alternative is to reuse the original char array object, and not allocate any other char array objects.  This can be done by: making a temporary string from the entire char array object, and then making the new strings using tempString.substring(offset, offset + length)For 1000 strings, this will save 999 char array object overheads (probably about 16 bytes per).An additional space savings is possible by reusing the same string object for equal strings.

texts:Improve default annotation style assignment of CAS Editor
DefaultColors.assignColors() assigns style background with somewhat random but different bright colors to all types. This method is called when is type system is not known yet.AnnotationStyle.getAnnotationStyleFromStore() tries to read to stored style. If there is no information, then the style is set underlined red.The situation in my use case is the following: I create a script with some type definitions resulting in a type system. I write some rules and test the result by taking a look at the xmi with the CAS Editor. Here, the first method is applied, because the type system is new. Then I write additional rules and add some other types. If I now review the result, the new types in the known types system are all set to red/underlined, because if the second method. Thus, it's harder to distinguish them.A solution is the assignment of a random bright background color as default in AnnotationStyle.getAnnotationStyleFromStore(). However, the colors shouldnot change randomly if the type system changes. So after a style is assigned, this style should be stored inside the configuration, instead of repeating the process the next time the CAS is loaded. If the process is repeated and a change occurs to the type system, then the style assigning code might choose a different color.

texts:Donation of uimaFIT
Donation of uimaFIT.uimaFIT provides Java annotations for describing UIMA components which can be used to directly describe the UIMA components in Java code without the need for traditional UIMA XML descriptors. This greatly simplifies refactoring a component definition (e.g., changing a configuration parameter name). uimaFIT also makes it easy to instantiate UIMA components without using XML descriptor files by providing convenient factory methods. This makes uimaFIT an ideal library for testing UIMA components because the component can be easily instantiated and invoked without requiring a descriptor file to be created first. uimaFIT is very useful in research environments in which programmatic/dynamic instantiation of UIMA pipelines can simplify experimentation. For example, when performing 10-fold cross-validation across a number of experimental conditions, it can be quite laborious to create a different set of descriptor files for each run, or even a script which generates such descriptor files. uimaFIT is type system agnostic and does not depend on (or provide) a specific type system.

texts:add a jcasgen-maven-plugin (and m2e connector)
To properly use JCasGen in a Maven build, it would be nice to have a real Maven plugin dedicated to JCasGen. The current workaround is a bit complex: you have to use a uimaFIT wrapper of JCasGen plus the exec-maven-plugin and the build-helper-maven-plugin:http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/uima-user/201010.mbox/%3C4CC06F1D.3010206@ogren.info%3EThis workaround also interacts poorly with Eclipse. There's no m2e connector for the exec-maven-plugin, which means you have to add some configuration to your pom:http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_coveredAnd then the plugin will be executed on every build - even if you haven't modified they type system descriptor - which can be quite painful for large type systems.Instead, I'd like to see a jcasgen-maven-plugin that allows you to write something like:<plugin>  <groupId>org.apache.uima</groupId>  <artifactId>jcasgen-maven-plugin</artifactId>  <configuration>    <typeSystem>src/main/resources/TypeSystem.xml</typeSystem>  </configuration>  <executions>    <execution>      <goals>        <goal>generate</goal>      </goals>    </execution>  </executions></plugin>This plugin would also have a corresponding m2e connector that only runs JCasGen when the type system file changed.I spent some time trying to put a first draft of these two things together. Here's a jcasgen-maven-plugin:http://cleartk.googlecode.com/git/jcasgen-maven-plugin/And here's an m2e connector for that plugin:http://cleartk.googlecode.com/git/jcasgen-m2e-connector/If you'd like to try them out, I've deployed the jcasgen-maven-plugin to Maven Central:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22jcasgen-maven-plugin%22And I've created an Eclipse update site for the m2e connector:http://cleartk.googlecode.com/git/jcasgen-m2e-connector/org.cleartk.plugin.jcasgen.m2e.repo/target/repository/The pom XML snippet I gave above should work, except that the group is "org.cleartk" instead of "org.apache.uima".Is there any interest in this? I'd be happy to help transition the code over to Apache if others would like to see this as part of the UIMA distribution.

When TikaAnnotator is part of a PEAR file, then when you call UIMAFramework.produceAnalysisEngine() and Tika asks the system for an XML parser, it fails with the exception:javax.xml.parsers.FactoryConfigurationError: Provider for javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory cannot be found This is because the XML parser is now built into Java, but the UIMA classloader (used with PEAR files) finds the parser implementation in xml-apis.jar first, which is older and incompatible with the current XML interfaces.  xml-apis.jar is included because it's one of the eventual maven dependencies for Tika 0.7.  See this issue for more information:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-412This was fixed in Tika 0.8.A work-around for those UIMA users who want to use TikaAnnotator in PEAR files with Java 1.6 is to exclude xml-apis from their PEAR file:<dependency>   <groupId>org.apache.uima</groupId>   <artifactId>TikaAnnotator</artifactId>   <exclusions>     <exclusion>       <groupId>xml-apis</groupId>       <artifactId>xml-apis</artifactId>     </exclusion>   </exclusions> </dependency>However, a better fix would be to update the version of Tika used in TikaAnnotator.

texts:Add CAS interface method that allows user to obtain a list of Markers associated with a given CAS
Add a convenience function that removes the need for applications that create Markers for many CASes to separately manage them (e.g., map CAS to its related Marker), and thereby simplify application code.Today's current level of support allows a user to create a Marker for a given CAS (through the createMarker() method which is part of the CAS interface).This proposed support will allow the user to subsequently query a given CAS and obtain a complete list of Markers created against this CAS. This function is a natural extension to the given level of support (i.e., if one can create Marker for a given CAS, one should be able to query the CAS to find said Marker.)Having this support significant simplifies application code, offering advantages from a memory overhead, performance, and maintainability standpoint.  For example, the application won't need to build and maintain a map of CASes to Markers, given the Marker is hanging off the CAS to begin with.

texts:Modify UIMA-AS JMS Listener to Allow Incoming CAS While The Listener is Stopping
When in quiesce mode, the UIMA-AS service stops its jms listeners to prevent more CASes from coming in. In a rare event when the listener is told to stop, it may actually may be reading a message from its queue. In such case, the jms listener rejects the message. This effectively results in a message loss. The listener should allow the message to be processed instead. There is an API which allows for programmatic override of the default behavior acceptMessagesWhileStopping(true/false). The UIMA-AS code should change the setting to true to allow the message while the listener is stopping.

texts:add lenient version for binary compressed serialization/deserialization
Extend the binary compressed serialization to support cases where the type systems are not exactly the same.There are 2 use cases.First: the source is a previously saved file. The goal is to deserialize it into e.g. a tool, where the type system in the tool may be somewhat different than the type system used to create the file. (For instance, it may be at a different version level).Second: the source is a client for a UIMA-AS service.  In this case, the client has read the service's type system, and has merged it with its own.Difference in the type systems could be:Type exists in one, not in the other; Type exists in both, but with different features (including those from super types).  Features could be added/subtracted.  Features could have different ranges (incompatible ranges should cause error messages).A suggested impl approach: create a mapper that maps typecodes and feature codes; set it up by comparing two type systems.  For the first use case, implement a version of deserialization that takes an extra input of the source type system, and creates the converter, and then does deserialization with the conversions.  For the 2nd use case, during initialization time, after the service's type system has been read (for merging into the client's type system definition), use this to create the same mappper between type codes / feature codes; when sending a CAS via binary serialization, send it via the mapping converter for type codes and feature codes. Try to arrange things so that the creation of the mapper can be done once per "set" of CASes, rather than once per CAS.Note that managing out-of-type-system data is superseded by support for delta-CAS formats.

texts:UIMA-AS JMS Listener Not Recovering After Broker Restart
When a broker is bounced, uima-as service is not fully recovering if it uses multiple listener threads per destination. Only some of the listeners recover which reduces throughput. When a connection is lost all listener threads call Spring API which blocks and auto retries a connection to the broker until success. It looks like, this API is not re-entrant and if multiple listener threads try to recover the connection bad things happen. This is more of the uima-as bug than Spring in my opinion. All listener threads share the same connection so it is fine if only one of the threads is involved in the recovery. Fix uima-as listener to allow a single listener thread to call Spring API to recover broker connection

texts:JCasGen fails to update descriptions in JavaDoc
When I update the description field of features in the Eclipse Component Descriptor editor and run JCasGen, most of the time the descriptions for the types are not updated in the generated JCas files. The "Updated by JCasGen" timestamp is updated, but the JavaDoc on the getters and setters is not updated most of the time. I even thought that generating JavaDoc on setters/getters wasn't supported until I actually looked at the JCasGen source code.Deleting the generated types and re-running JCasGen seems to help some times, but most of the time it just seems that it doesn't make a difference.E.g., I added "lala" as a description on a type feature and successfully generate the JCas with "lala" ending up in the getter/setter JavaDoc. Now I remove "lala" from the description (it's empty now), delete the JCas files from disk and rerun JCasGen. In the freshly generated files, "lala" is still there.

On IBM Java 6, there is an occasional failure in Arrays.sort used to sort the strings in the heap.  The failure is an out-of-stack-space error.  It is very intermittent.  I had earlier seen this, and had wrapped the call to Arrays.sort in a try/catch loop which caught the out-of-stack-space.  The code would retry this once, after reversing the array (thinking this would change things to avoid the out-of-memory).  In further extensive use, this error has popped up again, even with this retry.  Need a better workaround.

uimaj-core doesn't build on JDK 7. It looks like inner classes are preferred over imported classes in JDK 7, hence there are errors when the type Type is used in subclasses of AWT Window which contains Window.Type.Aparrently, Tomasso has set up a UIMA build with JDK 7 on Jenkins which reproduces this problem. I couldn't find any issue about it though.Is there any particular reason why this has not been fixed yet?

texts:Redesign Eclipse Update Site for P2 and Maintainability
We have several projects that use Eclipse features and their associated plugins: uimaj-sdk: the set of basic plugins, like the Component Descriptor Editor, the Pear packager, the Eclipse Debug support, base runtime, etc. uima-as: adds support for the deployment descriptor to the Component Descriptor Editor cas-editor (currently packaged as part of the uimaj-sdk) textmarker----------The Update site manages various versions of these, and also supplies a top level "categorization" of these.  The categorization is supplied (currently) in the top level "site.xml" file.  In the P2 layout, this is provided by thecategory.xml file (there's an editor in Eclipse to create / maintain this).We currently are using the categories: uima-tooling-and-runtimes uima-as-toolingConvert to an approach which has multiple update sites, bound togetherby one top-level aggregate update site.  This site lists thesub-sites; the Eclipse (P2) install support reads this, finds the sub-sites,reads them, and aggregates all of this into a seamless set of menus, as if all of these sub-sites had been put together.  This design choice is taken to improve future maintenance.  For example, to update the textmarker, only that sub-site would need updating.Make the subsites just be subdirectories of the published composite update site.The "categories" can be cross-cutting, across sub-update-sites.  For instance, if we continue to have the category uima-tooling-and-runtimes then a sub-update-site might categorize some of its features here.Given that Eclipse has had support for P2 install formats since 2008, drop the no-longer used site.xml and digest.zip files.Convert the uimaj-eclipse-update-site to build a "subsite" for the compositesite, in the P2 style. Change the build steps to use the p2 style Ant tasks, as pioneered by Peter.  Change the build to fetch the entire set of versions, so the P2 builders can do their work with the complete set.Delete non-packed artifacts that have corresponding packed ones to reduce the size requirements. Add a new project, builds/trunk/eclipse-composite-update-site, based on the eclipse-packagings project. Updates to this would only be needed when the composite structure is changed.  Make this reference (initially)two sub-update-sites - the uimaj-eclipse-update-site, and a new update sitefor the uima-as project.  TextMarker would be a third update site that will be added once it's released.Change the uima-as project to add a new update site for it, which will "add"the deployment editor feature, in the P2 form.Update the build/parent-pom to change the update site build to use the new P2 tooling, to share consistent build and configuration setups across multiple update sites.

texts:@ExternalResource - key should default to name of annotated field instead of the field type name
While analyzing some comments on uimaFIT recently on the UIMA users mailing list, it occurred to me that the default value for "key" should probably be the name of the annotated field, not the name of the type of the annotated field. That means  public static final String FOO_KEY = "foo";  @ExternalResource(key = FOO_KEY)  private Foo foo;could be written as simply  @ExternalResource  private Foo foo;However, this would mean that   bindResource(desc, DummyResource.class);wouldn't work anymore, because this kind of binding relies on the fact that the key defaults to the field type name. I think though, that this is a rather rare case.Btw. the UIMA mailing list post is: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/uima-user/201103.mbox/%3cloom.20110321T183824-248@post.gmane.org%3eGoogle Code Issue: https://code.google.com/p/uimafit/issues/detail?id=71

texts:Provide ability to cancel an individual DUCC Job Process
Presently, a DUCC Job may be unable to make forward progress (including termination) due to a Job Process &#91;JP&#93; that was dispatched to an Agent that is no longer communicating.  The only way to rescue this Job (without recylcing DUCC itself) is to have the Agent start reporting again, which may not be feasible (for example a HW problem has caused the system to crash and precludes system boot and therefore Agent from running).Provided here is the ability to cancel a particular JP, thus making any and all incomplete Work Items previously dispatched to that JP re-deployable elsewhere.The DUCC CLI is enhanced to provide the --dpid flag to the job cancel command.Note well:  if there is any possibility that the target JP is active but the Agent is not, then this flag should not be used, so as to avoid the possibility of the same Work Item being processed by two JPs simultaneously.

If a node dies with a work-item that is starting but not confirmed so it goes into Limbo, RM continuously allocates a new node until the pool is exhausted.Correct behavior is for RM to allocate only sufficient nodes to make up for the dead one, based on remaining work.To reproduce, start a small cluster and fire off a job with a couple hundred short (5-10 second) work items.  Once all nodes are full issue SIGSTOP to one agent and JP.  This should cause at least one WI to go into limbo.

texts:Fill description of component and parameters from JavaDoc
Since the maven plugin runs at at build time and has access to the sources, this is a unique opportunity to extract descriptions of components and parameters from JavaDoc. The @ConfigurationParameter annotation provides for a description, but I always found it inconvenient to maintain the description twice, once in JavaDoc and once in the annotation. uimaFIT currently has no support for component descriptions.Often, the JavaDoc in uimaFIT components is not added do the parameter variable, but rather to the parameter name constant. So auto-completion in the IDE is use on PARAM_<ctrl-space>, it lists all the parameters along with their explanation. /** * A user-definable value. */public static final String PARAM_VALUE = "value";@ConfigurationParameter(name=PARAM_VALUE)private String value;For this reason, the maven plugin should support looking for parameter documentation not on a field, but rather look for a constant field in the component that starts with PARAM and has as value the name of the field - if such a constant is found, its JavaDoc should be used.

texts:Mark enhanced files to avoid processing them multiple times
Add a marker annotation (e.g. @Enhanced) to classes that have been processed using the "enhance" goal of the Maven plugin. When the plugin runs again, e.g. during an incremental build, this marker could be detected and the reprocessing could be skipped immediately. This should improve the build times in Eclipse.Since the annotation has to be in the class file, it has to be added to the uimafit module. If it was only in the uimafit-maven-plugin, the enhanced classes could not be loaded unless that module was on the classpath.... well, actually I think they could be loaded, but we've had issues with findbugs annotations that Eclipse couldn't resolve when analyzing the class file, so probably better avoid such situations (cf. https://code.google.com/p/uimafit/issues/detail?id=78).

New jobs dependent on services reset the affected pingers to a high-rate of ping to insure responsiveness.

texts:DUCC should provide job cancel by proxy capability
Presently, DUCC job submit provides the ability to wait for job completion before exiting via the --wait_for_completion flag, and to automatically cancel the job when ctrl-C is invoked via the --cancel_job_on_interrupt flag.  In the case where the submit+monitor CLI combination is terminated by, say, kill -9 the job is (unfortunately) not automatically canceled.To remedy this deficiency, the DUCC webserver (WS) will act as proxy to receive periodic "I am alive" requests from the submit+monitor CLI, and if these requests cease to arrive for some ducc.properties configured interval, then the job is auto-canceled.

While TextMarker can cope with loading its main script relative to the classpath, it can't load dictionaries from it. That feature is very useful in production enviroments.Attached is a patch that enables that. It also tries to "bubble" up the exceptions in the low level classes a little bit more (currently TextMarker "eats" a lot of exceptions, that's something most probably to be addressed in UIMA #2567).Of note: both MultiTreeWordList and TreeWordList will silently ignore their parameters (and load nothing) if it doesn't end in a "magic" extension (e.g., "txt" or "twl"). Shouldn't they throw an exception or at least log a warning? If so, that could be worth another bug report.

Here are some small typos and other issues I noted while going through the TextMarker documentation:(page 7, Section 1.4)BLOCK(English) Document{FEATURE("language", "en")} {// rules for english documents}BLOCK(English) Document{FEATURE("language", "de")} {// rules for german documents}--> shouldn't it be?BLOCK(English) Document{FEATURE("language", "en")} {// rules for english documents}BLOCK(German) Document{FEATURE("language", "de")} {// rules for german documents}(page 8)"The next exmaple" -> "The next example"(page 9)”The first rule deletes all text covered by annotations of the type “DEL”." -> type "Date"?"The last rule finally performs all of these changes in an additonal view called“modified”." -> this look unclear from the example, it looks to be missing some parameters. It is all clear after reading Sect. 1.5.4, you might want to add a link to that section.(page 10)neccessary -> necessary  (2 times)(page 11)neccessary -> necessary(page 12)extact -> exact(page 21)the ampersant expression example is wrongly rendered(page 23, Section 2.3.4)shouldn't W+? CW on "123 456 small small Big" match no only "small small Big" (as mentioned in the text) but also "small Big"?(page 54)A block declaration always starts with the keyword “BLOCK” , followed by the identifier of the block within brackets. --> within parenthesis? RCULRY -> RCURLY (page 58) the example file is separated by semi-colons, but the text refer to it as a comma-separated file. (page 77) Add the diagram at http://tmwiki.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/attach/TextRulerIntroduction/TextRulerProcessModel.PNG ? (page 78) Table 3.4, the publication column is off by 1.

changed files:
texts:DUCC webserver (WS) auto-cancel feature should not be enabled for "shadows"
The auto-cancel feature is enabled when --cancel_on_interrupt flag is specified at submit time.  When this flag is specified, the WS expects to receive regular pings from the submitter, which are automatically supplied by the associated monitor.  If pings are absent for too long (config'd in ducc.properties via ducc.ws.job.automatic.cancel.minutes) the WS proceeds to cancel the job.It is possible to run multiple WS instances (aka "shadows").  Since only one is ping'd, the other(s) will detect a ping timeout and incorrectly cancel the job.The solution is to have only the "primary" WS as the monitor+canceler.  This is determined by matching the specification in ducc.properties for WS host:port with that of the actual host:port of the WS.  Only if these match will the auto-cancel code be enabled in the WS.To bypass this problem until fix is delivered, run only a single WS.

This doesn't seem to impact the test case, but the example pear files in uimaj-tools/src/test/resources/pearTests/pearMergerTests can't be run.  They aren't compatible with the latest Apache UIMA code, for example they still refer to org.apache.uima.jcas.impl.JCas, even though that has since been refactored and JCas moved to org.apache.uima.jcas.JCas.  These should be fixed using the migration tool, so that they can be used for other testing purposes.

This is ok because if they're not registered, they're not in a cycle.  If they are registered later, the topo sort will occur as part of registration and they'll then be included, so all is well.

SLF4J: Found binding in &#91;jar:file:/home/challngr/ducc_runtime/lib/slf4j/slf4j-log4j12.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class&#93; SLF4J: Found binding in &#91;jar:file:/home/challngr/ducc_runtime/lib/springframework/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.11.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class&#93; SLF4J: Found binding in &#91;jar:file:/home/challngr/ducc_runtime/lib/apache-activemq/activemq-all-5.6.0.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class&#93; SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation. Seems benign, but annoying. One possible fix for this is to remove slf4j jars from spring and amq. The Ducc's assembly script should exclude them from the DUCC tarball. The slf4j jars will be picked up from ducc_runtime/lib/slf4j dir.

There are several places where an array of ints gets added to an int vector, by iterating over the array, and calling the add(int) method.  This can be improved by having a bulk add operation that does various growing/bounds check just once, and then does the copy using System.arraycopy.  This has a measurable effect (not too much, but observable) on things such as CAS serialization.

Using UIMA-AS client sendAndReceive() API to send CASes to remote Cas Multiplier can cause the client to hang. With the synchronous API, the client is receiving child CASes from the CM and deserializes them using its internal Cas Pool. The child CASes are never delivered to an application since the callbacks are not supported for sync API. The code never releases the CASes causing a hang in the client due to exhausted Cas Pool.Modify the client code to ignore child CASes produced from an input CAS sent via synchronous sendAndReceive(). While ignoring such CASes, the code should still send FreeCasRequest to the remote CM to prevent the CM from starving its Cas Pool. The new code should not attempt to deserialize child CASes and just throw away the message containing serialized CAS.

On UIMA-AS process startup, the provided deployment descriptors are passed through the dd2spring which generates a Spring context file used to initialize the UIMA-AS service. Once the initialization is done the context files can be removed. The dd2spring actually creates the context files as temp files and configures the files with removeOnExit(). In most cases this works, however when the UIMA-AS service is killed with -9, the temp files remain in the default temp dir accumulating over time. The DUCC runtime frequently kills the services to make room for another process so these files temp files do in fact accumulate in the temp dir. It seems like the agent should spin a thread, check temp dir for old temp files and clean them up. The cleanup would have to be done via ducc_ling as the files are owned by users.

texts:TextMarker: Add wildcard rule element
Right now, something like a wildcard or an I-don't-care rule element can be implemented with ANY*?. However, those rule elements actually investigate each token until the next rule element is successfully matched, meaning they are slow if there is some space in between.A real wildcard, which just skips everything, would really be useful (and faster). This can be implemented by not iterating over the visible inference annotations, but actually finding a matchable position in the index and then check whether it is visible. Since the next rule element can possibly quite complex, it is maybe better to just match to the next annotation, and if that one is invisible, then return a failed match. This behavior needs actually some careful testing in different use cases.First suggestion for the syntax (** for wild card):CW **{-> MARK(Type)} PERIOD; The "**" is maybe not the best solution since it looks quite like a quantifier *?. Introducting an actual keyword can also be problematic since they might be a type with the same name. Maybe something likeCW #{-> MARK(Type)} PERIOD; is better.This rule would create an annotation from the end of each capitalized word to the begin of the next period, including the white spaces. However, those can be removed with the TRIM action.

texts:DUCC resource manager - Restart and fast-start
Currently RM waits a "reasonable time" (init-stabiity) on startup to allow nodes to check in, before accepting scheduling requests.  It is not possible to know exactly how long to wait, making init-stability a heuristic.  For normal startup this is not a problem.  If RM is restarting 'hot', or if the orchestrator publishes non-preemptable jobs on restart, and the necessary nodes have not arrived by the completion of init-stability wait, this can cause many problems: over-commitment, under-commitment, and in some cases  inconsistent state (and crashes).To remedy this, RM will include the full Node object in its publications to the OR, which will echo them back for work that it believes to be active. On startup RM can fully reconstruct state as of its last publication from this, eliminating the problem. A side-effect of this is that RM need not wait for nodes to check in, significantly decreasing its startup time.  If nodes added to the resource pool in this way never check in, the normal "dead node" mechanism will kick in, maintaining consistency.

The class FSCollectionFactory should not be generic.The inner classes should not inherit from FSCollectionFactory.The inner classes should be public or potentially be moved to top-level classes.I believe these changes break binary compatibility, so I'll schedule them for 2.0.0.

With the pending arrival of CGroup support, the RM "friendly" share IDs must now be unique as they are also to be used as the containers for each CGroup, and eventually, for injected Managed Reservations.Previously this wasn't necessary as internally, Share Ids use Java UUIDs and hence are globally unique over time; the "friendly" id was a convenience for human beings to refer to shares.RM will start persisting the monotonically increasing "friendly" ids of shares as they are assigned.

Currently, there can only be one external resource per key, e.g.:  final static String MODEL_KEY = "Model";  @ExternalResource(key = MODEL_KEY)  private SharedModel model;---AnalysisEngineDescription aed1 = createPrimitiveDescription(Annotator.class,  Annotator.MODEL_KEY, extDesc);There are cases where we want to pass a multiple external resources at a time, e.g. multiple models when can be used jointly by a component. It is inconvenient to have the component declare one key per model, because we do not know their number in advance. Adding support for adding multi-valued external resources in uimaj-core looks like a major change, as the XML descriptors would need to be extended. At the level of uimaFIT, it should be rather easy to implement something like this:  final static String MODEL_KEY = "Model";  @ExternalResource(key = MODEL_KEY)  private List<SharedModel> model;---AnalysisEngineDescription aed1 = createPrimitiveDescription(Annotator.class,  Annotator.MODEL_KEY, asList(extDesc1, extDesc2, extDesc3));uimaFIT may implicitly bind the three values to "Model#1", "Model#2", and "Model#3".

texts:Add CGroup support
Modify ducc to use Linux cgroups. Currently, only cgroup memory subsystem will be used to limit amount of memory a process is allowed to use. Cgroups provide a light weight virtual machine for processes.An agent will launch processes in a cgroup container. The agent on start up should check a global flag in ducc.properties to enable/disable use of cgroups. Also, the agent should check if cgroups are properly installed on a node by checking for existence of /cgroup/ducc folder. The final check is against an exclusion file which may facilitate disabling cgroups on per machine basis. If cgroups are enabled, the agent will launch processes in a cgroup container. For JPs and APs, the first process assigned to the container will be the primary/owner of the container. The agent should support injecting other/secondary processes into an existing container. If the JP primary process terminates, the agent will proceed to kill secondary processes and finally remove the container. If the AP primary process terminates, the agent will kill secondary processes but will not remove the container. Same will be true for JDs. In both of these cases, the container is associated with a reservation and thus the container should remain for as long the reservation is open.  The agent will also monitor use of swap space by each container. The container threshold will be computed by ducc based on assigned number of shares to the container. For example, if the container is assigned 1 15GB share on a machine with 45GB total memory, ducc will constrain the container to 1/3 of total (minus 1GB) swap space.

JCasUtil Subiterator returns annotations which are not within the border of the container (parent) annotation if parameter "strict" is set to "false" See attached maven project for test setup, java classes, a SIMPLIFIED typesystem and the test CAS xml-file. We have two annotations, "SentenceAnnotation" and "ValueAnnotation". A "SentenceAnnotation" covers a sentence and the "ValueAnnotation" covers a numerical value. We have the following example plank text:   "This is sentence A with no value. This is sentence B with value 377."  Creates two sentence annotations ("This is sentence A with no value." and "This is sentence B with value 377.") and one value annotation ("377").  Now, if i want to get all "ValueAnnotation" within a "SentenceAnnotation", i iterate over each "SentenceAnnotation" and use JCasUtil.iterator(...) to get the ValueAnnotations with the following parameters: JCasUtil.iterator(currentSentence, ValueAnnotation.class, false, false);  As a result, i get for the first sentence also the value of the second sentence and this might be wrong because even if "strict" is set to "false", the  begin of the "ValueAnnotation" should be smaller than the end of the "SentenceAnnnotation". But in the example given the begin of the "ValueAnnotation" is after the end of the FIRST "SentenceAnnotation"

UIMA uses the standard java.util.logging (JUL).  Most of my company's code used Apache Log4J, so we have a problem merging the messages from the two logging packages.  Given that UIMA is now an Apache project, I think it makes sense that it work with Apache logging.Two options occur to me:1. Change all the logging calls in the code (perhaps Eclipse refactoring tools can help with that).  Here's some discussion on migrating: http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2005/12/migrating_from_jdk_logging_to.html You could convert either to Log4J ( http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs ) or to Apache Jakarta Commons Logging ( http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging ), which would allow UIMA to be configured to use either JUL or Log4J.2. Write/find a JUL Handler that re-directs to Log4J.  Here's an example: http://home.gwu.edu/~amrinder/chainsawHandler/UsingChainsawWithJDKLogging.html

texts:Expose FSIterator via (J)CasUtil.select*() methods where applicable
Some of the uimaFIT (J)CasUtil "select" methods work directly on an FSIndex or FSIterator. In those cases, it would be nice if the methods didn't just return a Collection, but some FSCollection<T> in which the iterator() method returns an FSIterator<T>.At least in those cases were an AnnotationIndex is used, it would be possible to actually return something that implements Collection<T> and FSIndex<T>, so it can be used in constructors like new ArrayList(...), in modern-style for loops, and for type-save access to the index. In those cases were an FSIterator is used because the type searched for is not an annotation, the FSIndex<T> interface is not a good choice, because it contains several methods that cannot be implemented based only on FSIterator.So maybe two interfaces: FSCollection<T> based on FSIterator and AnnotationCollection<T> based on FSIndex/AnnotationIndex.This mainly exposes more details of UIMA AnnotationIndex via CasUtil. JCasUtil's select method doesn't make a different between FSes that inherit from AnnotationFS or not. Here, the only benefit is getting access to an FSIterator.

(as reported by Eric Riebling on the mailing list, but this has been bothering us for a long time also, and I just confirmed it with the exact same exception)When running CPE GUI and a Collection Reader is already part of theconfiguration, if you click "Browse.." to select a different CollectionReader (or even the same Collection Reader), a null pointer exception isthrown.

texts:getting a named index from the index repo sometimes returns the wrong index
Test case IteratorTest succeeded on my workstation but failed in Jenkins.  This test was recently modified to be more thorough, and in particular, checks to see that a set index doesn't have multiples of the same key.The failure was reproducable on my workstation by running with Sun Java version 1.5.  Analysis of this showed that the code in the index repository implementation to find an index by name, for a particular type, was only checking if the index on a type had the same "comparator" - that is, the set of keys and compare order, as the "named" index.  This failed to distinguish the case where there were 2 defined indexes, one being a "set", the other "sorted", with exactly the same comparator definitions, as is the case in this test.  The result was the findIndex method picked the first one it found - and it found in the failing case, the sorted index.Fix this by adding a test to findIndex that checks the indexType (e.g. Set, Sorted, Bag).

texts:List resources in a ResourceManager / remove hack in uimaFIT
uimaFIT currently gets a list of resources that are registered with a ResourceManager. This is handled via accessing the "mResourceMap" field of the ResourceManager_impl class via reflection. Obviously, this is not a good solution.uimaFIT iterates over the resources in the context while initializing resources that are referenced from other external resources.There may be two options: add a listResources() method to the ResourceManager interface get the resources that need to be initialized in some other way. I don't know if there is one, because if there was, I'd probably have used it. Looking at the @ExternalResource annotations doesn't help, because they do not give informations about the resource bindings. The bindings are only available in the ResourceManager, which takes us back to 1).Would it be possible to add a method allowing to list the resource bindings registered in a ResourceManager to the ResourceManager interface?

texts:DUCC Web server - follow normal GUI conventions where feasible
The web interface probably should be designed for the non-expert user.  As such, a good message in place of "MonitorActive" is "Running Normally".  If you want to indicate some extra-ordinary kind of status, you might have the hover text indicate that the job was submitted with an option that permits it to be cancelled by -insert user action here- (don't say "interrupt" - as a non-expert user won't know what that means in terms of a user action.  If it means that the "terminate" button on the left works, they you might say that).When a job enters the state "ending" (but not fully ended), this field could read "Job is Ending".  When the job is ended, this field could read Job Ended normally, or some indication that it didn't end normally, and why.The hover in general should be consistent with the message, and supply more details of interest to the non-expert user.  For instance, if the message is Running Normally, the hover might say "Running Normally. To manually cancel, use the terminate button on the left."In any case, I would not use the hover to inform the user about some auto-cancellation feature that is like a cleanup if the client dies.

texts:Type System Merging for string subtypes with allowed values
UIMA uses type system merging to combine separately developed annotators and their type systems.  When the same type is define in multiple type systems, perhaps with different features, these are "merged" where possible, and if not possible, exceptions are thrown.  The current implementation is missing any support for merging subtypes of Strings - which UIMA uses for associating Allowed-Values for.  If two type systems define the same-named subtype of String, no merging of allowed values is done, no exception is thrown if the allowed value sets are different, and the merge uses the first definition as the merge result, ignoring the others. The behavior could be changed to be "strict" - throwing an exception if the allowed values are not identical, or more lenient - for example, having the merged definition be the union of the the sets of allowed value.  The drawback to the union approach is that any annotator which was assuming a "closed universe" of possible values, could now be seeing values not in the set it expected.

texts:DUCC Service Manager incorrect handling of autostart for ping-only services
Ping-only services don't have service instances.  The autostart logic works by comparing declared instances to started instances and starting new instances to match the declared number.Since ping-only services have no instances, autostart never starts anything!  Must take into account ping-only in the autostart logic.Related, and found in the same debugging session, the (old, temporary, to cope with AMQ OOM issues) timer to kick off CUSTOM pings needs to be switched to the proper timer as used by the internal UIMA-AS pinger.Further - it is hard for the web server to know what is going on with a ping-only service because there are not active instances.  The Service Manger will start placing state into its meta properties file to indicate whether the pinger is active or not : meta.ping-active and whether the service is in fact a ping-only service: meta.ping-only = true

texts:jcasgen-maven-plugin needs to support patterns
With the old JCasGenPomFriendly class in uimaFIT, it was possible to select the descriptors for which JCas wrappers should be generated using a wildcard pattern:<configuration>  <mainClass>org.apache.uima.fit.util.JCasGenPomFriendly</mainClass>  <arguments>    <argument>file:${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/org/apache/uima/fit/type/**/*.xml</argument>    <argument>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/jcasgen</argument>  </arguments>  <classpathScope>test</classpathScope></configuration>With the current jcasgen-maven-plugin, only a single descriptor file is possible. This is quite inconvenient for users. At least there should be the same possibility of specifying a wildcard pattern as in the JCasGenPomFriendly. Even better would be, to combine that with the commonly used include/exclude pattern used in many Maven plugins, e.g.<plugin>  <groupId>org.apache.uima</groupId>  <artifactId>jcasgen-maven-plugin</artifactId>  <executions>    <execution>      <goals> <goal>generate</goal>      </goals>      <configuration>        <typeSystemIncludes>          <typeSystemInclude>src/main/resources/types/**/*.xml</typeSystemInclude>        </typeSystemIncludes>        <typeSystemExcludes>          <typeSystemExclude>src/main/resources/types/**/nojcas/*.xml</typeSystemExclude>        </typeSystemExcludes>      </configuration>    </execution>  </executions></plugin>

texts:jcasgen Maven plugin: add option to exclude generating for imported types
Add an option, perhaps something like <skipGenerationForImportedTypes>, which if true (not the default) would only generate those types which were defined directly (that is, not via an import) in the set of type system descriptors specified as input for this plugin.Rationale from UIMA-1176Our project reuses a common type system that we got from a different source. The common type system descriptor is imported into our main type system descriptor. The common type system has its own JCas types, in a jar file.When we generate JCas types for our main type system descriptor, it currently generates all of the classes for all of the imported type systems as well. We don't want this behavior, so we have to manually go through and delete those classes.I think JCasGen should only generate types for the type system descriptor that you run it on, not on imported type system descriptors.One way to solve it as described in UIMA-2471Jg.main0 takes an array of string arguments. To make JCasGen limit the cover classes it generates to just those whose type definitions are contained in some directory (at any sub directory level), you pass 2 additional arguments in this array:1) "-limitToDirectory" and then following that2) the path to some directory. Currently this is typically set to a containing Eclipse project directory, for example, when JCasGen is called from the Component Descriptor Editor

texts:upgrade maven-dependency-plugin to >= 2.6
Currently the UIMA-wide parent pom specifies maven-dependency-plugin version 2.3.  The currently released version is 2.8.  As of version 2.6, a new configuration parameter, useBaseName, is available which prevents resolution of versions 2.4.1-SNAPSHOT from being converted to 2.4.1-20130303.12345678 where the last 2 numbers are the snapshot being used.  This feature is needed to get SNAPSHOT builds working for the new design of Eclipse Runtime packaging - where the design embeds Jars inside Jars.  Here are the details:We build OSGi bundles / Eclipse plugins, which sometimes are collections of other Jars.  The current best practice is to embed those Jars without unpacking them, thus preserving any License/Notice files they may have, etc.Felix's maven-bundle-plugin supports this using the packaging "Jar", and the instructions _exportcontents, and Embed-Dependency.  In this design, the dependency section of the POM contains references to all the Jars that have packages that are needed.  The bundle plugin uses these instructions and the Maven dependency information to create a Manifest Bundle-ClassPath entry which has the names of the needed dependent Jars.Another build step, outside of the Felix bundle step, uses Maven dependency plugin's copy-dependencies, to copy the Jars to the target/classes spot, where the maven jar plugin looks for building the final Jar; this creates the Jars-inside-Jar structure.  Unfortunately, when uploading Snapshots to Snapshot repositories, Maven renames the x.y.z-SNAPSHOT Jar to some name like x.y.z-20130303.12345678 where the last 2 numbers are the timestamp of the Jar.The default for older versions of the maven dependency plugin, when copying the Jar from a snapshot repository, is to keep the -20130303.12345678 style suffix, instead of using the base name -SNAPSHOT.  This convention breaks the Felix bundle build, which put into the manifest in multiple spots the name using the -SNAPSHOT convention.More recent versions of the maven-dependency-plugin (after 2.6) have a new configuration parameter, useBaseName, that has Maven use the -SNAPSHOT name locally, when fetching from a remote repository.  This is the default, in version 2.6 and later.

texts:m2e builds potential conflict when doing Jars with maven
The m2e integration in Eclipse for Maven does incremental builds as needed.  One side effect of these is to create in target/classes/META-INF/maven/&#91;groupId&#93;/&#91;artifactId&#93; the two files: pom.xml and pom.properties.When the normal Maven Jar plugin runs, it uses an archiver configuration which (by default) has the addMavenDescriptor set to true.  This causes the archiver 1) archive everything in target/classes (including the META-INF/... that m2e may have built), and then it adds its own pom.xml and pom.properties, in the same place as the m2e did.The result is the zip file has a directory that actually has 2 copies of these two files.(Note, this won't happen if you build from the command line using "mvn clean install" - the "clean" step will delete the target/ before building).Normally, having multiple files in a directory inside a Jar doesn't matter to anyone.  However, the build for Eclipse Update Sites runs the packager which includes (re)packing the Jar files to compress better, and this, in turn, runs some Zip thing which throws an exception if it finds 2 files with the same name in a directory.The easy workaround is to always use mvn clean before install.It should be easy to fix this, though - by having a step run ahead of the Jar plugin which deletes these two files (if they exist).  I think that would be "safer" in that things would always work...  Right now, if by chance you forget to do clean, and are using m2e, the Jars get built in this funny way, and nothing notices, until much later, if you try and include these Jars as part of "runtime" Jar in an Eclipse Update site.It's not just the eclipse plugin jars; any jars included in the runtime (e.g. uimaj-core, uimaj-cpe, uimaj-tools, etc.) also must have this cleanup because the pack200 is run on those too.

texts:Improve release of Eclipse Update sub-sites
Take advantage of the existence of the Apache dist.apache.org SVN site used for releases to reduce the release work for new versions of existing update subsites.A subsite is typically a collection of features and plugins, at various "versions", plus metadata that catalogs these items in two files: contents.jar and artifacts.jar.  The subsite also has pack.gz versions of the plugin Jars, and checksums and signatures for the Jars and pack.gz things.With each new version, the old versions of the features and plugins do not change; just new versions are added and the metadata files are updated; all new and changed files get new checksums/signatures.Change the build process to:  a) checkout the existing subsite  b) build just the new versions  c) compute the new metadata and use the "append" facility to add to the existing metadata  d) allow "committing" just the new/changed files to the dist repo after the vote passes.Since the update site build process no longer has any need of information about previous versions, change the update-site organization and POM to have less special updates needed (previously, it needed lists of previous versions, etc), and make it align with the conventional way other projects are built, where possible.Make the category.xml a filtered file - substituting the "version" from the POM instead of hard-coding it.Incorporate checksums and signings into the normal mvn build process, under the apache-release profile (so other builders don't need to do this part).Add the common part of all update subsite building to the uima-wide parent pom; activate by having a file named "marker-file-identifying-eclipse-update-site"

I think it is not achievable to ensure the same matching behavior independently from the current matching direction, because of the greedyelements. If the user wants to take advantage of other matching directions, then a manual selection of the anchoring rule elements would be a good solution. We need to find a nice syntax for this extension. It could look like:// match everthing from the last period to the last token...PERIOD # 'LastToken; // ' indicates the anchoring elementHere, the rule would start with the LastToken and then will search for the next PERIOD.

Apparently the ResourceManager and the resources created by the manager do not participate in the usual component life cycle.

At least any resources derived from Resource (e.g. DataResource and ParametrizedDataResource) should be notified. The SharedResourceObject interface does not define any such life cycle callback.As a side-note: An alternative to the rather heavy-weight Resource interface of UIMA maybe be small life cycle interfaces such as the Spring InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces, or Java annotations marking initialization and destruction methods (e.g. @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy).

On fast systems (with local disk vs NFS), the OR can easily win the race and the logdir is written with incorrect ownership.

(Issue reported on SourceForge by Greg Holmberg)Class com.ibm.uima.cas.impl.Serialization is notdocumented in the JavaDoc.Since class CAS doesn't implement Serializable,Serialization is the only way to (efficiently)transport a CAS Java process to Java process (via RMIor Jini).Also, Serialization seems to be missing a method.There is a "CASSerializer serializeCAS(CAS)" methodbut no way to deserialize it. There is a pair thatworks on Streams, but there is no "voiddeserializeCAS(CAS, CASSerializer)" method.Secondly, the method serializeCASComplete() takes aCASMgr, which is also undocumented. Perhaps thisshould be modified to take a CAS instead of a CASMgr?

DocumentAnalyzer writes some files (e.g., annotationViewer.js) to temporary directory.  If it does not have permissions to write those files, then it throws an exception and does not start.  It gives these files the same name each time.  If there are multiple users with the same temporary directory (e.g., /tmp), one of those users runs DocumentAnalyzer and writes these files to /tmp.  By default, other users are not given write permissions to that file (even though they have write permissions to the directory).  Thus they cannot override the file and when they try to run DocumentAnalyzer, it does not start.

There are 2 issues - the artifact names of all the tests are the same "simple" - a cut/paste thing.

On one linux machine we have, a very old level of the maven-compiler-plugin is being set to 2.0.2 - this level is so old that it ends up defaulting a Java source level to 1.3  - which causes the compile to blow up because Java annotations weren't supported back then.  The fix: give these test poms a parent that sets the plugins used for building to more-or-less current levels.

This is somewhat subtle as many things need to be taken into consideration to determine if a service is "healthy".For the moment, we will use the single heuristic, "is the queue depth too big" to better draw attention to potential (but maybe not actual) problems and defer more complete analysis to a later time.

texts:Getting feature value from feature structure longer than expected
Should getting a value of a feature in a feature structure be fast? Intuitively, I would expect performance to be about the same as getting an entry from a Java HashMap or faster but in my experiments it seems to be 8 times slower. To solve my problem, I wrap my feature structures with caching Java code but it seems that there might be an opportunity to speed up UIMA generally.My test creates a CAS with a single feature structure in it. It sets a string feature in that feature structure and then simply gets the value of that feature in a tight loop. I compare that to an instance of a Java class that has an internal HashMap of strings to strings. In that case, a method is called on that instance to get an entry from the map in a very tight loop. I do 5 rounds of each of the loops. The total times for the rounds involving the CAS were:round 0 total time 1: 7.520104509sround 1 total time 1: 6.812214938sround 2 total time 1: 6.882752307sround 3 total time 1: 6.728515004sround 4 total time 1: 6.813674956sThe total times for the rounds just using the Java class were:round 0 total time 2: 0.847296054sround 1 total time 2: 0.814570347sround 2 total time 2: 0.814399859sround 3 total time 2: 0.814189383sround 4 total time 2: 0.814979357sHere is my Java code:MyTest.javapackage test;import java.io.InputStream;import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Map;import org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework;import org.apache.uima.cas.CAS;import org.apache.uima.cas.Feature;import org.apache.uima.cas.FeatureStructure;import org.apache.uima.cas.Type;import org.apache.uima.resource.metadata.TypeSystemDescription;import org.apache.uima.util.CasCreationUtils;import org.apache.uima.util.XMLInputSource;public class MyTest {    static class MyClass {    Map<String, String> myFeatures = new HashMap<String, String>();        void setStringValue(String feature, String value) {      myFeatures.put(feature, value);    }        String getStringValue(String feature) {      return myFeatures.get(feature);    }  }    static public void main(String[] argv) throws Exception {    InputStream stream = TestSupport.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("MyTypes.xml");    TypeSystemDescription typeSystemDescription = UIMAFramework.getXMLParser().parseTypeSystemDescription(new XMLInputSource(stream, null));    CAS cas = CasCreationUtils.createCas(typeSystemDescription, null, null);    Type myType = cas.getTypeSystem().getType("MyType");    FeatureStructure fs = cas.createFS(myType);    Feature myFeature = myType.getFeatureByBaseName("myFeature");    fs.setStringValue(myFeature, "myString");    cas.addFsToIndexes(fs);        MyClass myInstance = new MyClass();    myInstance.setStringValue("myFeature2", "myString2");        long iterations = 100000000;    double nanoSecsPerSec = 1000000000.0d;        for (int round = 0; round < 5; round++) {      long start = System.nanoTime();      for (long i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {        fs.getStringValue(myFeature);      }      long end = System.nanoTime();      System.out.println("round " + round + " total time 1: " + ((end - start) / nanoSecsPerSec) + "s");    }          for (int round = 0; round < 5; round++) {      long start = System.nanoTime();      for (long i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {        myInstance.getStringValue("myFeature2");      }      long end = System.nanoTime();      System.out.println("round " + round + " total time 2: " + ((end - start) / nanoSecsPerSec) + "s");    }  }}Here is my type descriptor:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><typeSystemDescription xmlns="http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier">  <name>MyTypes</name>  <description/>  <version>1.0</version>  <vendor/>  <types>    <typeDescription>      <name>MyType</name>      <description/>      <supertypeName>uima.cas.TOP</supertypeName>      <features>        <featureDescription>          <name>myFeature</name>          <description></description>          <rangeTypeName>uima.cas.String</rangeTypeName>        </featureDescription>      </features>    </typeDescription>  </types></typeSystemDescription>

This seems wrong, but it apparently has been this way for a while.

(Our example CAS Consumers' default output directory is set to C:/Temp in their descriptors.)However maybe this is related to UIMA-300, in that writing named files to the /tmp directory on Linux doesn't work well with multiple users, since they cannot overwrite each others' files?What's the right behavior here?  Maybe the output of the CAS Consumers should be relative to the working dir, but then probably not under a directory named "temp".

texts:Break up sequential matching in Ruta rules
Break up sequential matching in Ruta rules: Right now a list of rule elements specify a sequential pattern. In some use cases, however, the sequence of annoations is not as important as the their existence. An example: A rule should fire, if some complex annotations patterns occur within a sentence whereas the location or order is not important. Two use cases can be distinghuished: "and" and "or". A disjunctive matcher is already implemented, but only suppport simple matching conditions, but not complex patterns (e.g., additional conditions) for the alternatives. I am still thinking about the best syntax for this. Right now, my favorite is a special character that separates the rule elements. An example:BLOCK(b) Sentence{}{  CW PERIOD & SW COLON;}... a sentence that contains a capitalized word followed by a period AND a small written word followed by a colon, regardless of where they occur in the sentence.Maybe also something like the follwoing is then possible:NUM (CW{REGEXP("A") -> MARK(NUMA,1,2)} | CW{REGEXP("B") -> MARK(NUMB,1,2)});

texts:Add workaround for maven plugin-plugin bug
The maven-plugin-plugin is used in several projects to help build maven plugins.  Two of its goals, helpmojo and descriptor, extract info about the plugin from annotations.  A recent change deprecated the use of javadoc-style annotations, in favor of Java 5 annotations, and we've changed our maven plugin projects to Java 5 annotation style. Unfortunately, this style is broken for these two goals in the maven-plugin-plugin, because the goals end up in many cases (including during release:prepare, and if you use "clean install") being run before the compiler runs.  The scan for these Java annotations scans the compiled code (which is not there yet, after, for instance, a clean has been run but before the compiler has run), and doesn't find any.Two Jira issues (currently unresolved) address this: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5346 and http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MPLUGIN-238The way the helpmojo works - appears not to necessarily depend on having the annotations at that time.  The generated helpmojo class is data driven, and works off of an XML file it finds in META-INF/maven/org.apache.uima/<name-of-plugin>/plugin-help.xml.  When the helpmojo is run, it does 2 things: it generates a generic helpmojo java source, and it uses the annotations it finds to generate that datafile (plugin-help.xml).  If this is run together with a later run of the "descriptor" goal, then that latter goal regenerates the plugin-help.xml.So, things work if you run the helpmojo goal before the compiler step - it generates the helpmojo java source code to be included in the compile, and a "bad" version of the plugin-help.xml resource, provided you set the flag to tell it to not stop if there are no annotations found. If the descriptor goal is then run after the compile step, it regenerates the correct plugin-help.xml resource and puts it into the compiled output in the right spot (since it's a resource, it doesn't need to be compiled).This is how the workaround proposed by MNG-5346 works.Workaround this here by setting the phase for the maven-plugin-plugin descriptor to run after compile, and setting the configuration to <skipErrorNoDescriptorsFound>true</skipErrorNoDescriptorsFound>. Note that build steps that want to invoke this have to specify the plugin in their build plugins configuration, and use the id "default-descriptor", if they have additional configuration needed.

texts:Docbook build script usability issue
If you try to run the docbook build script (or mvn assembly:assembly) from a source distribution, you get the expected file not found error because the docbook files are missing.  However, you will be left with an empty docbook/docbooks-xsl-1.70.0 directory.If you now follow the instructions on the website and obtain the docbook/zip directory, and then re-run the build script, it will fail again, with the same error message.  I think the problem is that it sees the empty docbooks-xsl-1.70.0 directory and assumes you have already successfully unzipped the docbook files, so it does not even attempt to unzip them again.The workaround is to manually delete the empty directory before re-running the build.

texts:2.4.1 release reports errors and fails where 2.4.0 was silent
A user tested some "Pear"s (packaged UIMA pipelines) with 2.4.1 and found they failed to validate, whereas they were fine in 2.4.0.Traced this to some new code in ConfigurationManager_impl, which added some logging for configuration parameter settings, if you specified the log level to be CONFIG.  The process of generating the information that went into the log message was being done, even if the CONFIG level was not enabled.  This information included a printed representation of the parameter value.  Because of this, the code access the parameter settings.  The old code never did this, I think.The access, if the value was an array (multiple-values-allowed == true), attempted to convert the setting value to an array.  This failed in the PEAR example, because the PEAR configuration had an error - the setting was unused - so it had a value of <string/> whereas it should have had a value of <array/>.  While this could be fixed in the PEAR, from the users point of view, this may be more or less difficult - they may just be consumers / users of PEAR files developed by others, and not know how to fix this, or to get the original supplier of the PEAR to do so.  We should not throw an exception in this case, but do something more reasonable - since this occurs in the logging message, we should report this in the log message, instead.Furthermore, for efficiency, we should avoid doing all log message work unless the log level would allow logging at the CONFIG level, here.

(2) After the vote passed, they were "uploaded" to people.a.o; the upload tool converted the cr lf to just lf upon upload.Add a build step after the javadoc generation which runs the ant fixcrlf task on the .html files.

texts:Eclipse launcher plugin fails if uimaj-core not on project classpath
The Launcher launches a small Java class which needs the uimaj-core classes to run.  The Launcher includes the project's classpath, so if uimaj-core is on that classpath, all is well.  But there's no requirement that uimaj-core be on the project's classpath (for example, imagine a project for an aggregate, that just contains xml descriptors, etc.).  In that case, the failure happens.The launcher is attempting to handle this by suffixing the uimaj-ep-runtime jar to the launched classpath.  That worked in 2.4.0 and earlier, because that plugin jar had all the uimaj-core classes.  However, as of 2.4.1, we changed the packaging of this, and the uimaj-ep-runtime is now set up to have embedded jar files, with an OSGi Bundle-Classpath which identifies these Jars.  That doesn't help this Jar's usage as just a plain (non-OSGi) Jar.  Reported by Peter Klügl who also discovered the fix in project Ruta.  The fix here is slightly faster - only the uimaj-core jar is included (that's all the launcher class needs).

For deployments consisting of async aggregate, the uima-as does not allow concurrent processing of input CASes. In this design, the thread servicing an input queue is intentionally blocked until the input CAS is fully processed. Only than, the thread is allowed to dequeue the next CAS. This design was motivated by the desire to enforce fair load balancing where each service/process takes as many CASes as it can process without blocking waiting for a free instance of a CAS (from service CasPool). The motivation is still valid, but it looks like the implementation of the idea is wrong. Suggestion is to force the service thread to fetch a CAS before trying to dequeue a CAS. This design ensures that the service only takes as many CASes from a queue as it is capable of processing.

texts:Don&#39;t link sources in JavaDoc
Marshall Schor says:Here's some remarks on the Javadocs; I don't see this as a release issue though.I see the conventional javadoc configuration was overridden by uimaFIT in thatit turned on the flag "linksource".The convention in other UIMA projects has been to try to separate user-facingClasses from internal implementation things, and have the Javadocs be only foruser things.  To that end, the normal convention also has the javadocs exclude"private" methods.Turning on the linksource adds the sources to the Javadocs, and inserts links tothe sources from the corresponding javadoc classes and methods.Although this is convenient, and may be desired, it has the disadvantages ofputting the source tree (at least the part that the Javadocs document) into thejavadoc html tree, as html files.  This of course adds lots of files to the apidoc tree, and is a duplication of the source available via svn.  (For instance,the source can be obtained at an html link:http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/uima/sandbox/uimafit/tags/uimafit-2.0.0-rc1/ etc.)The other potential downside (which may be of no consequence in the case ofuimaFIT) is that adding the source, of course, exposes all the private internalstuff.  I agree this is only an issue if the goal of the Javadocs is to "filter"the info into user-facing and internal details, and omit the internal details(which may change more frequently than the user-facing stuff).-Marshall

texts:Switch to UIMA-style project structure
Given how the UIMA parent POM sets up the build process, there is no way to resist the "UIMA-style" of having different structures for project inheritance and aggregation. Root-level POM should be aggregator and dist builds (containing dependencies on all modules).General configuration should be moved to "uimafit-parent" module from which all other modules inherit.

texts:Remove unnecessary plugin configurations
Marshall Schor notes:There are spots in this pom which are overriding a parent (uima, apache, ormaven-central), but maybe don't need to, or shouldn't?One example - there's a long list of versions in the pluginDependencies, one ofwhich specifies the javadoc plugin 2.9.  The parent-pom in v 6 has updated thisto 2.9.1, in order to pick up a fix which corrects a security hole in javadocgeneration we were asked to implement in all our javadocs.The general principle in the "local" parent pom is to keep it as empty aspossible, only overriding things in the uima-wide parent pom (or its parent,etc.) for a reason.  This way, improvements/corrections done in these poms getproperly promulgated to all builds.  The intent, when we update the uima-wideparent-pom, is to collect from all the project parent-poms anything they'vediscovered needs doing, that is general (beyond just that project), and move itto the parent, and then delete it from the sub-parents.For instance, at the moment, there's a change in v 7 (not yet released) of theuima-wide parent pom, which runs an ant step when doing the apache-releaseprofile (only) that looks for generated javadocs and if it finds them (in the"conventional place", it runs the ant fixcrlf task against the .html files,because (1) javadoc produces inconsistent line endings, and (2) because we now"publish" these by commiting them to SVN, the commit fails if there areinconsistent line endings (and you have specified eol-style:native, which wehave by default for .html files).So, I would expect to see this in your (local) parent pom (since v7 isn'treleased yet), but almost none of the other stuff.

texts:cleanup "additional parameters"
Many user-facing APIs have a parameter, called additional parameters, which is a Map, for passing additional, arbitrary parameters.These APIs are often associated with user-facing interfaces, and have static final String constants that name the "keys" for these parameters.The placement of these static final String constants is not consistent.  For example, there are duplicates ( both Resource and AnalysisEngine interfaces define "PARAM_CONFIG_PARAM_SETTINGS" ).  It's probably worth checking to see if there are any missing, and if they are defined at the "right level".  My guess is that moving these may break some user code; if so, I'd say it isn't worth removing misplaced ones.  But I would add missing ones at the "right level", and make all other instances have their definition set to the the "master" (the one defined at the right level), so there's no doubt that duplicates are intended to have the same exact definition.The right level, I think, in a hierarchy of interface definitions, is the highest point for which the parameter makes sense (but not higher).A scan of uimaj-core produced these candidates, some of which have multiple definition spots:PARAM_AGGREGATE_ANALYSIS_ENGINE_NAME = "PARAM_AGGREGATE_ANALYSIS_ENGINE_NAME"; PARAM_AGGREGATE_SOFA_MAPPINGS = "AGGREGATE_SOFA_MAPPINGS"; PARAM_CONFIG_MANAGER = "CONFIG_MANAGER"; PARAM_CONFIG_PARAM_SETTINGS = "CONFIG_PARAM_SETTINGS"; PARAM_EXTERNAL_OVERRIDE_SETTINGS = "EXTERNAL_OVERRIDE_SETTINGS"; PARAM_MBEAN_NAME_PREFIX = "MBEAN_NAME_PREFIX"; PARAM_MBEAN_SERVER = "MBEAN_SERVER"; PARAM_NUM_SIMULTANEOUS_REQUESTS = "NUM_SIMULTANEOUS_REQUESTS"; PARAM_PERFORMANCE_TUNING_SETTINGS = "PERFORMANCE_TUNING_SETTINGS"; PARAM_RELATIVE_PATH_RESOLVER = "RELATIVE_PATH_RESOLVER"; PARAM_RESOURCE_MANAGER = "RESOURCE_MANAGER"; PARAM_RESULT_SPECIFICATION = "RESULT_SPECIFICATION"; PARAM_TIMEOUT_PERIOD = "TIMEOUT_PERIOD"; PARAM_UIMA_CONTEXT = "UIMA_CONTEXT"; PARAM_VERIFICATION_MODE = "VERIFICATION_MODE";

texts:Simpler XMI writing than XWriter
The whole FileNamer thing in XWriter is more complexity than most users need. You have to declare a new FileNamer class every time you create an XWriter. But that FileNamer class, even though it takes a JCas just like an annotator would, isn't actually an annotator, it's a totally different API.We should instead leverage our users' existing understanding of the annotator API. If they're going to have to write a new class every time, we should let them write an annotator class like they're already used to. We should provide a simple static method that makes it easy to write such a class, something like:public class XUtil { public static void writeXMI(JCas jCas, File outputFile) throws IOException, SAXException {  FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(outputFile);  try {   ContentHandler handler = new XMLSerializer(outputStream).getContentHandler();   XmiCasSerializer serializer = new XmiCasSerializer(jCas.getTypeSystem());   serializer.serialize(jCas.getCas(), handler);  }  finally {   outputStream.close();  } }}(The new XUtil class could also grow methods for writing XCAS, and for reading XMI and XCAS.)More discussion here: https://code.google.com/p/uimafit/issues/detail?id=121

The reverse direction though didn't work.  1.4 XCASes can be deserialized ok (after at least one sofa-related bug is fixed).  However, CASes from Vinci seem to be missing the document text (on purpose, probably), and the document text is what triggers the sofa compatibility code.  When that code is not triggered, an exception is thrown later.  Michael says he remembers that we've seen and fixed a similar issue for 1.4.

It seems the result stems from iterating over alle token anchors of the document and checking the list for possible matches and only annotating each anchor only once.I would like the operator to annotate each token only once and not each anchor.GreetingsGeorg

texts:last change to uima-build-helper-maven-plugin broke it in 2 ways
The last change to this plugin was 2 things:1) Change from using javadoc style annotations to Java 5 annotations2) accidentally introduce a bug that broke date formatting1) is broken - didn't follow the docs for how to do the Java 5 style, and as a result, the "phase" in which to run this was not specified - causing it to be skipped.2) If you forced this to run, it generated an exception trying to convert an object to a date.  This was because a cast to (Object) was inserted in the method call:MessageFormat.format("{0,date," + ps.getFormat() + "}", (Object) now);The "format" method has a signature of (String, Object ...).  Casting the "now" value (which is an array of 1 Object) to (Object) made Java pass an array, the first element of which was an array of one object.The correct cast is (Object[]).  The reason this was inserted is because Eclipse issued a warning, which I didn't read correctly (was speed reading ).Probably need to check all other "improvements" to use Java 5 annotations for maven annotations, to correct others also done incorrectly.

Currently there is one exception type in CasUtil.selectSingle(CAS cas, Type type) method for the case if CAS does not contain an Annotation or CAS contains more than one Annotation. However, I sometimes need to differentiate between these two cases in exception handling.

If a service is unregistered a stop is issued to all instances and global state is set to Stopping.

Internal state gets frotzed so query and attempts to reregister the service fail, but retries to unregister or stop it fail.  The solution is to insure that, when stopping, the Cumulative State of the service is never allowed to progress regardless of the instance state at any moment.

texts:building Eclipse Update SItes - use better method for release
The current build for an Eclipse release achieves "safety" (from accidentally promoting a release before it's ready) by doing 2 distr.apache.org..../dev/ commits:  one to delete the current copy of the update-site, the other to "copy" the current update site to the /dev/ spot.I tried an improved method having 0 commits, which uses "switch" - checkout from ...release and then a local switch to ...dev.  However that didn't work, see the question and responsehere: http://markmail.org/thread/xcpyyezj6ourgbez#query:+page:1+mid:2eqyo3xmxldy2uoi+state:resultsSo I'm changing this to remove the "safety".  This means the update site build, when done with -Papache-release (which is applied either by the mvn user or by the mvn release:... plugin), will svn checkout into the target spot for the eclipse update subsite, the existing update subsite, from ...Release.Which means, that after the new site has been built, and the release vote has passed, you can commit the changes right back to the ...release spot.If by accident you commit before you want to, you can always manually fix this by reverting that commit.  So it doesn't have too much downside - the real downside is that SVN hook on commits which launching "mirroring" of the changes the 100's of sites mirroring the Apache distribution.The update site, when done without -Papache-release, does no svn checkout from the .../release update site.   Your "test" update site will be OK, but will be missing previous releases.  If you need the previous releases, run with the -Papache-release.

texts:Enhance XMI Serializer to support merging multiple XMI documents into a single CAS
The new feature would support the following scenario:1) A CAS is serialized to XMI.2) Copies of the XMI documents are sent to multiple remote services3) Each remote service appends to the CAS (does not delete or modifyexisting stuff) and responds with a new serialized XMI CAS)4) The multiple XMI responses are all merged back into a single CAS instanceThis would permit multiple remote services that don't depend on eachother to run in parallel, assuming they only append to the CAS (whichis common).  Of course there's other work on the runtime needed toactually do the parallel invocations, but XMI serializer support is aprerequisite.The basic XMI deserializer changes aren't too complicated.  First,when the CAS is originally serialized in step 1, we make available tothe caller the maximum xmi:id value in that CAS (this is mostlyalready done, we just need to add a public accessor for this value).Next, we allow passing this value to the deserializer as an optionalargument that essentially says "deserialize only XMI elements whosexmi:id is greater than the specified value".Discussion here: http://www.mail-archive.com/uima-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg02338.html

texts:TypeSystemDescription throws ClassCastException
Hi all!We have received a strange Exception from the Type system of uimafit maybe you can help us to fix it.1. First we loaded the type system from different xml-files like this:typeSystemDescription = TypeSystemDescriptionFactory.createTypeSystemDescriptionFromPath(                    "app/models/linguistic/descriptors/LexicalUnits.xml",                    "app/models/linguistic/descriptors/Punctuation.xml",                    "app/models/linguistic/descriptors/Word.xml",                    ...);2. Then we created JCAS document JCas jCas = JCasFactory.createJCas(typeSystemDescription);      3. Then we loaded the pipeline through aggregator like this: AggregateBuilder builder = new AggregateBuilder();        // create resource manager        SimpleNamedResourceManager resourceManager = new SimpleNamedResourceManager();        resourceManager.setExtensionClassPath(Play.application().classloader(), "", true);        // build pipeline        builder.add(createPrimitiveDescription(LanguageAnnotator.class));4. And then we wanted to iterate the annotations of the daugther type which was created in one of the annotators:Collection<Word> col = JCasUtil.select(jCas, Word.class); for (Word word: col){...}=> In this place (* ) the system threw the ClassCastException, that Annotation.class cannot be casted to Word.class.Inside any annotator the same lines don't throw any exception, this happens in the main program only. What could we do wrong?The problem may lay in the resource loading, since we use ResourceManager which loads the classes for the types from the PLAY (Web framework) Class loader. Maybe we have to set the ResourceManager also for JCas? Maybe our problem is described in chapter 5.6.7 of the UIMA Tutorial but in this case we also don't understand what to do.We use IntelliJ IDEA and MacOS.Thank you for your help.

texts:Fix Ducc Agent thread leak
For every process the Agent launches, it instantiates a Metric Collector object which gathers process metrics like CPU, swap, and many others. The metric collection is driven by a Camel route at regular intervals. Once the process stops (or dies) the route is shutdown.Within Metric Collector object, each metric is collected in a separate thread managed by a thread pool. The main motivation is to collect metrics in parallel to improve performance. There are two separate problems in the current code:1) The code uses a wrong type of thread pool, namely newFixedThreadPool. This pool has a fixed pool of threads which never expire even if idle. A better choice is the CachedThreadPool which creates threads on demand, reuses idle ones and kills those that are idle over 1 minute.2) The thread pool is never shutdown when the process is shutdown. The code actually shuts down the Camel route which drives metric collection but its processor ( java object doing the metric collection) does not shutdown its thread pool causing the leak.

texts:Flow Controller API extensions in support of more complex flow options
1)  ParallelStep - a new subtype of Step that the Flow Controller canreturn.  The ParallelStep constructor would take a List of keys,indicating that multiple AEs could logically be run in parallel.  Notethat the runtime may or may not actually execute them in parallel - ina collocated deployment it certainly would not.  In a remotedeployment we can (eventually) support parallel execution by makinguse of the XMI merging support I put in.2) Dynamically adding/removing AEs from the aggregate.  This would bea new set of FlowConroller APIs:removeAnalysisEngines(List)addAnalysisEngines(List)each of which takes a List of keys.  The AnalysisEngine metadata mapavailable through the FlowControllerContext would also be updated.This supports error handling such as the "disable" action in thecurrent CPM, allowing removing a misbehaving AE from the flow.Someday it could also allow adding new AEs to an aggregatedynamically.The Flow Controller could throw an exception in response toremoveAnalysisEngines, indicating that the aggregate cannot continuewithout the removed AEs (or that the flow controller simply can'thandle dynamic removal - maybe that should be the default in fact).3) Notification of errors to allow continuing after a failure.  Thiswould support an action like the current CPM's "continue" action.There would be a new API:Flow.onFailure(String failedAnalysisEngineKey, Throwable failure)If the runtime wanted to continue after a failure, it would call thismethod on the Flow Controller, and then would go back to callinghasNext/next.  Without this notification, a "continue" action wouldn'tmake much sense, because a dynamic FlowControlle may make anassumption that the last step it issued completed successfully.Note for #2 and #3 the existing framework won't call these methods, yet.  These Flow Controller extensions are a  prerequisite for doing moreadvanced flow things like parallel flows and error recovery.

It automatically set 2-way console redirection.  When invoked as 'viaducc' the first non-config parameter is taken as the executable to run.  When invoked as java-viaducc the first non-config parameter is the name of a class to run, and a JVM is found to run it with.  User may specify the JVM, and it not specified, the JVM configured for DUCC is used.  If java_viaducc is installed in the same directory as the JRE binaries it recognizes this fact and may be invoked as an alternative to Java, thus allowing Eclipse users to execute their workspaces in a DUCC-managed resource.  Too cool.

The CDE allows picking a Java implementation class for a primitive annotator.

However, if the user puts their XML descriptor into a separate project, which is not a Java project, then this strategy throws an "unexpected exception".  Change this behavior so that if the XML descriptor is in a non-Java project, have the Search search the entire workspace for candidate impl classes, to generate the pick list.

texts:Do not use same timeout on GetMetadata as is used for Process
The Vinci client descriptor currently has one timeout setting, which is used for all operations, including the GetMetaData call and the Process call.  For services that do very expensive processing, this timeout must be set to a large value so that the Process call can complete.  However there's no reason that the timeout should be so large for the GetMetaData call.  This is an issue because if the service is hung, it would be nice if GetMetaData (the first call that the client makes) would return an error after a relatively short amount of time, rather than waiting for the full process timeout to elapse (which could be several minutes, or more).

Building on the infastructure implemented in UIMA-327, we should provide a built-in flow controller that can be configured to return ParallelSteps and/or to continue after errors.  There are a few options:1) extend the existing <fixedFlow>.  This could be messy to do (in the Java API) in a backwards compatible way2) add a new kind of flow object, .e.g. <complexFlow>.  Also would need a corresponding flow controller that interprets it (or possibly just modify FixedFlowController to handle both <fixedFlow> and <complexFlow>)3) do this entirely with configuration parameters in the FlowController.  This can be done with the existing framework code (and wouldn't require CDE changes as 1 and 2 would).  But it is more of a change from what the user is familiar with.  Still, flow controller configuration parameters are a very general solution and if we think this is the way of the future maybe we should go ahead and use them now.

When a process exits normally or terminates due to a kill not initiated by DUCC, the Agent marks the process as Failed with Reason Croaked.

In such case, the high bit in the return code will be set. When the process exits not due to a signal is where the problem exists. No way of knowing why that happened. This is user code and as such cannot be relied upon. Modify the agent to change state of the process to Stopped instead of Failed. If the process was killed by an agent the reason should be KilledByDucc both for APs and JPs. If the process exited on its own, the reason should be Other.

texts:"generate" goal should include type system imports
The "generate" goal of the uimaFIT maven plugin should include type system imports in the generated descriptors. This would make those descriptors directly usable in descriptor-based workflows such as CPE or UIMA-AS.In our case, we point to the TS descriptor files directly in types.txt, thus not relying on any "magic" TS discovery. This could translate directly to a corresponding import by name in the XML descriptor. More sophisticated setups might of course be more difficult to handle.

This makes sense, since if the JP does get the work item it will process it.  However, the JD will begin queuing "extra" work items since it does not understand that such work items are not really lost.  This may increasingly aggravate the problem by having the JD put out to queue more work items than the present JP capacity can handle.

I think I understand this problem.  Bhavani's job 96348 happens to have excellent characteristics with 1 JP and 1 thread.It seems that one of her work items causes the JP to explode (Croaked).  The work items fails.  The JD marks the work item as Error.  So far so good.  The JD proceeds to queue the next work item for processing not realizing that the lone JP has vanished.  This is a mistake.  Correctly, a new JP is allocated by the Scheduler, and not until its initialization is completed does the longtime queued work item get picked up.The JD should probably be more cautious about queuing work items in the presence of failed ones.

Default is 20 for jobs & 5 for services.  Since semantics are different (applies only to consecutive init failures in services) we should rename to --instance_failure_limit for services. Also could remove optional site-specific default as hasn't been used and all other defaults are in the code.

A user reported an array index out of bounds during XmiSerialization back from a uima-as service.

texts:More consistent handling of multiple add-to-index behavior for same Feature Structure
UIMA has a somewhat unusual indexing architecture.  You can define indexes (sorted, bag, set), and then add / remove a feature structure (FS) to all of the defined indexes.The design intention (I think) was to support the concept of a FS being indexed, or not.  However, the current design allows some anomalies that behave inconsistently between code being run "locally", versus as remote services (due to how serialization handles this).  Serialization encodes only the concept of a FS being either in an index or not. The problem arises in the edge case where the same identical FS is added to the indexes multiple times.  For local (non-remote) cases, for bag and sorted indexes, the same exact FS would be added multiple times.  This would have the consequences: Iterating would return multiple == FSs. Remove from indexes of a multiply-added FS would reduce the number by 1; the FS would still be in the index unless the last remaining one was removed..For the same code, running remotely, serialization would have "collapsed" the multiple additions into one, so would behave differently.This Jira changes the behavior of "add-to-index" so that  subsequent add-to-indexes of a same identical FS would be a no-op. To cover users who might be exploiting the old behavior, the JVM property "uima.allow_duplicate_add_to_indices", read when the UIMA classes are loaded, would restore the previous behavior.Note that with this change, the UIMA "Set" index still has a distinct purpose , separate from the "Bag" index, because it defines Feature Structure equivalence based not on identity, but rather on specified key feature values being equal.  This change better aligns how code running locally or remotely works.

texts:Vinci service deployment descriptor timeoutPeriod parameter does not work.
In the Vinci service deployment descriptor there can be an element:    <parameter name="timeoutPeriod" value="30000"/>This is supposed to be used when there are more concurrent requests on the service than there AnalysisEngine instances to handle them.  The service is supposed to wait at most the specified time (in milliseconds) for an AE instance to become free, and return an error if the timeout elapses.However this is currently unimplemented - services will wait forever in this situation.

Although UIMA-2434 improved time to remove from a sorted index, removal time from bag indexes is still likely to be order(number-of-elements that are in the index), because a sequential scan is done.

When entries are deleted from IntArrayRBT (used for UIMA "Set" indexes), the space used by those entries is not reclaimed. A simple fix would be to notice when the "size" went to 0, and then, if the array space used was large (say, at the multiplication-limit size), reset the storage back to the initial size. A more complex fix could be to put freed-up nodes on a free list and reuse them (this will have locality-of-reference issues, though).

I see some classes that look like tests in the main (non-test) source tree of atleast one project: uima-ducc-cli (see for instance,org.apache.uima.ducc.cli.ws.json, there are classes "MachineFactsTest" and"ReservationFactsTest".I think these should be moved to the normal maven spot (convention overconfiguration  ), so they get run automatically during the build (they wouldneed to be turned into junit tests too).A scan of the code shows 9 classes with the word "test" as part of the name, andnone of these are in the src/test/java conventional spot, so none of the testsare being run as part of the build, I think (I didn't check...).

a) The docs say this is accessed at port 42133.  Is this configurable? b) The docs mention two display modes: scroll mode and classic mode.  The website has "Table Style" for scroll/classic.  Is Table Style the same as "Display Modes"? c) A recent version of the ducc webserver I tried (not sure if it's the identical-to-trunk level), had some issues: In Google Chrome browser,  switching to Scroll mode made the header row have  column widths that were much wider than the rest of the data in the table, so  they didn't line up (even after trying both kinds of "reloading");  Firefox  didn't have this issue.  Is there a "recommended/required" browser people need  to use? Another issue was (in Firefox) the header columns don't re-size (in scroll mode)  when you change the browser width, even after refreshing with the "refresh"  button in the web page (but they do resize if you use firefox's own refresh button). After picking a sort index, the direction arrows become very hard to see on that  column (the color / size makes it hard to see them).  There's no apparant way to  "undo" the sort picking; you can sort on another column, of course.  (And, I  discovered that if you do a firefox-refresh (not the special in-the-page refresh  button), it seems to undo the sort - not sure this is working as designed though). Is any kind of multi-column sorting supported?  If I sort on one column, and  then pick on another column as the sort key, do items that have now have the  same sort key value, retain the ordering they had before the resort?

If you run the eclipse-update-site build 2x, not in -Papache-release mode, it doesn't clear out the target eclipse-update-site/subsite (on purpose - to avoid getting the older versions of things, in case you're testing that...).The step where it runs the Eclipse FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher seems to notice that older versions of things are in the target repository, with the same version #s, and it won't update them.  But it doesn't report any issues.  So if you forget to do "mvn clean install" and just do "mvn install" it looks like it makes an updated site, but actually, it doesn't...  Fix this with a silly workaround (because I don't know how else to do it in Ant): have the FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher write to a temp directory, which is always erased just before it runs, and then have another ant step copy these over the older ones. tried this, and many other variations; couldn't get them to work.  It seems the features & bundles publisher does some kind of fancy reading of the xml in the artifacts.xml and contents.xml and uses that information rather than seeing what files are actually there.  So, do something simpler and more fail-safe.

texts:UIMA pear runtime
Currently it is not possible to run an installed pear file out of the box in UIMA. I mean by just specifying the pear installation path or something similar.To run installed pear files there is a lot of user configuration and implementation necessary. So it would be nice to have a UIMA pear runtime that can run an installed pear file out of the box.With the suggestion of having custom resource specifiers <customResourceSpecifier> we can provide an easy way to integrate such a UIMA pear runtime.We just have to implement a new PearAnalysisEngineWrapper that extends the AnalysisEngineImplBase class that knows how to start an installed pear file. All the necessary information is available and can be parsed from the metadata of the installed pear. The utilities, e.g. to dynamically load the classes (UIMA extension class loader) is also in place and can be used. So an example of the <customResourceSpecifier> can look like:<customResourceSpecifier xmlns="http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier">   <resourceClassName>org.apache.PearAnalyisEngineWrapper</resourceClassName>   <parameters>       <parameter name="installedPear" value="/path/to/the/root/directory/of/the/installed/pear/file"/>       <!-- and additional parameters if necessary -->   </parameters></customResourceSpecifier>This solution will also work out of the box in our tooling. The tools does not have to implement a PEAR runtime engine itself.

After deleting the .m2 repo node org/eclipse, tried to build eclipse plugins and found the cas-editor was failing because it was trying to download a dependency on org.eclipse.equinox:app version 1.0.0.  The one in the repo is at version 1.0.0-v20070606.  I vaguely recall some slight upgrade in more recent Maven impls that slightly changed the matching rules for these kinds of things.  Anyways, it now doesn't match or work.  This wasn't noticed by me because I had never deleted the org/eclipse directory in my local maven repo before.The fix seems to be simple: I added an explicit dependency in the POM for this using a version range which got that version with the -v20070606 suffix.  Because it was there in the .m2 repo, some other part of maven dependency was successful in resolving it.

When converting an HTML file to plain text with HtmlConverter engine in Ruta, there exists an engine parameter "replaceLinebreaks" of type boolean to decide if text linebreaks should be replaced or not. If set to true, all linebreaks are kept in the document. If set to false, all linebreaks are deleted. Therefore, the last word of a line and the first word of the next line are put together without whitespace in between. It would often be better if a linebreak is replaced by a whitespace. To configure this, another engine parameter that defines the String, the linebreak is replaced with, would be useful.

Example 1: if cas1's viewname and cas2's viewname are both null (could be both base CASes, I think), then it returns the result of null == null because it's comparing the viewnames (null strings) instead of the base CASes themselves.The tests further may fail if the CAS is wrapped.  May need to use "equals" instead of == , but need to check the default impl of this.

texts:JMS service stub causes broker problems at high load
Scenario:A UIMA aggregate includes a JMS remote service, the aggregate is deployed in multiple threads and in multiple processes such that there are close to 1000 total pipeline threads, and the CAS rate going to the remote service is greater than about 100 per second.In this situation, which is common for a DUCC job, then the AMQ broker will start using an abnormally high amount of CPU while slowly delivering CASes to the remote service instances, resulting in poor throughput.Up until now the JMS service stub instantiates a new UimaAsynchronousEngine object for every thread. The problem does not occur if instead the JMS service stub instantiates a single UimaAsynchronousEngine object and uses it for all process threads pointing at the same remote service.

texts:Allow custom service adapters to be plugged in
Currently there's no easy way to plug in an additional kind of serviceadapter (to support a protocol other than SOAP or Vinci).  UIMAalready has the foundation for pluggable adapters, with its use ofdescriptors and factory methods that produce Resource objects (likeAnalysisEngines) from descriptors.  But we've never provided a way forusers to plug in their own adapter classes without editing internalframework configuration files.  Here's a simple suggestion that wouldchange that:We could add a new ResourceSpecifier (descriptor) type:<customResourceSpecifier xmlns="http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier">       <resourceClassName>com.foo.MyCustomServiceAdapter</resourceClassName>       <parameters>               <parameter name="serviceEndpoint" value="hostname:port"/>               ...       </parameters></customResourceSpecifier>The <resourceClassName> specifies the exact name of some user classwhich must be located on the classpath (the UIMA extension classpathwill work, if provided).  That class must implement the UIMA Resourceinterface (for an AE service adapter it would also have to implementthe AnalysisEngine interface).  The Resource interface provides amethod initialize(ResouceSpecifier,Map) which the factory calls andpasses the resource specifier.  The user would implement theinitialize method to read the <parameters> and set itself up.All the basic support for this is already there.  It's relatively easyto add a new kind of ResourceSpecifier and the associated factory forinstantiating the Resource from the specifier.  Then there would bethe documentation about how to implement your resource class, whichwould be a little more work.

Currently when creating a pear file it is not possible to set the UIMA datapath as a defined value. You can create your own custom parameter that is calleddata_path or DATAPATH or UIMA_datapath. But it is not defined how the UIMA datapath should be named. I would recommend to define:When a pear file must set the UIMA datapath the datapath parameter is called: "uima.datapath"With this definition it is also possible to provide an API at the current PackageBrowser object that returns the UIMA datapath setting for the pear file. Currently the PackageBrowser can be used to e.g. retrieve the custom parameter settings or the classpath of a pear. When adding the datapath API, pear files that needs the UIMA datapath can be integrated to UIMA more easily without using assumptions of what might the the UIMA datapath setting of the pear.I think the changes are quite simple. We have to update the documentation so that users know how to set the UIMA datapath and we have to implement an additional API at the PackageBrowser that search in the configuration parameters of the PEAR for the "uima.datapath" parameter.

If the first step fails (getting valid port), the code retries until a valid port is found. If the second step fails (bind), the code should log a message stating the JMX is not available and return empty string for jmx URL. The daemon should continue initializing despite the fact the JMX is not available

texts:AnnotationFactory.createAnnotation() should not throw UIMAException
The AnnotationFactory provides a shortcut alternative to creating an annotation and adding it to the indexes:JCas/UIMA:a) new Token(jcas, 1, 5).addToIndexes();b) jcas.addFsToIndexes(jCas.getCas().createAnnotation(JCasUtil.getAnnotationType(jCas, typeClass), begin, end));AnnotationFactorya) createAnnotation(jcas, 1, 5, Token.class);b) createAnnotation(jcas, 1, 5, typeClass);Internally, AnnotationFactory uses reflection on JCas classes to achieve that and if there is a problem while reflectively creating the annotation, it throws an UIMAException. It is very unlikely that a problem would occur. It could happen if security restrictions are in place on certain JCas wrapper classes. Yet, the UIMAException is not a RuntimeException, so it must be caught by client code. AnnotationFactory could use the CAS interface instead of reflection to avoid the exception. We can be sure that any annotation created through the CAS interface can safely be cast to a JCas wrapper type, because the JCas has already been initialized when this method is calls (it receives a JCas as argument).

texts:DUCC Agent sends STOP instead of QUIESCE to a running process
On process pre-emption (or explicit service stop), the Agent sends a Stop request to a JP or Service instead of Quiesce. The process receiving such request, stops all listeners on the input queue and also stops the output channel preventing any replies from getting back to the client (JD). The above may also explain intermittent problems with GetMeta timing out. It looks like GetMeta request comes in, the service receives Stop request and immediately proceeds to stop the output channel preventing the reply. The window is very small but its possible cause of the timeout.If a process is killed via SIGTERM, the registered ShutdownHook correctly initiates quiesce.

Either dont call onBeforeMessageSend() or pass an empty string as Cas Reference Id when handling CPC.

When handling the first request message from a client, the UIMA-AS service establishes a connection to a broker, creates a session and a producer and caches it for a subsequent use.

For example,  the wireFormat.maxInactivityDurationInitalDelay=M, to deal with Wire Format Negotiation Timeout errors which may occur when the broker is very busy or the network is saturated causing delays.Consider using a (optional) property file to externalize uima-as settings which are currently passed in via -D's.

texts:IntArray code to sort and remove duplicates fails on edge case of empty array
As part of serialization, the code which collects the set of indexed FSs has a portion which removes duplicates; this is run on an IntVector object which is collecting indexed FSs for a single type, FSIndexRepositoryImpl line 1531). This object is cleared and reused, in FSIndexRepositoryImpl, lines 1522 to 1532..  There's an edge case bug where this dedup routine fails for empty arrays - it returns an array of length 1, where the value&#91;0&#93; is whatever might have previously been there before the last "removeAllElements" (FSIndexRepositoryImpl, line 1522).If the 0-th element in this working IntVector happened to be 0 (which is the case on first use), then this will include the FS at address 0 (which is null, and has a 0 type code, etc.), which causes XmiSerialization to fail.The only time this error would manifest itself as a NPE is if a used, but now 0-length index for some type was the first index to be iterated over.Peter Klügl found this via a NPE while serializing a CAS, and it was order dependent.  I reproduced it by making a CAS, adding / removing an instance of an annotation (which is a sorted type), and then setting the text for the CAS (normal operation, setting the text for the CAS, then doing the other, would result in the DocumentAnnotation instance being created as part of setting the text, and it would be found 1st in the index collection code, thus insuring that position 0 in the working IntVector was not 0).The fix is to handle the edge case where the input array to sortDedup is of 0 length.

texts:UIMA-AS gets "Wire format negotiation timeout" on connection.open()
It appears that under heavy network load UIMA-AS is getting "Wire format negotiation timeout" Exception when opening a connection to a broker. The client side of AMQ is sending a frame containing its parameters to the server (broker). It reconciles clients params against its own and sends a reply  back to the client. The reply apparently never reaches the client causing the timer to pop (default=10secs) and an exception is thrown. Attempt to extend the client timeout via wireFormat.maxInactivityDurationInitalDelay=60000 doesnt fix the problem. One possible explanation is that either the client wire format frame is not reaching the server or the server's reply doesnt reach the client. This may be due to a lost TCP packet. Since the low level amq wire negotiation doesnt offer retry, the UIMA-AS may need implement a higher level retry around the connection open() logic. It should capture generic JMSException and check the associated description for "wire format ..." problem. In such case, the connection should be closed and reopened.

texts:UIMA-AS not handling broker url params correctly
When handling a reply the uima-as service creates a jms connection using broker url provided by the client and caches it for reuse. The broker url is actually modified to add wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=0 to turn off amq inactivity monitor. The problem is that the code assumes that the client's broker url doesnt contain any params and just appends its own with ?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=0.Assuming that client uses the following broker ur: tcp://localhost:61616?wireFormat.maxFrameSize=209715200The uima-as service code will incorrectly modify it as follows:tcp://localhost:61616?wireFormat.maxFrameSize=209715200?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=0.Whats strange is that the connection is made with the above with no error.The AMQ code seems to skip to the last ? and parses from there. The consequence is that client's parameters are lost.

texts:improve Cas FS to JCas cover instance map
In highly parallel environments running on multiple cores, profiling shows that the JCas map has performance issues due to volatile and atomic operations that are unneeded, but happen due to the use of the built-in Java Random function (which uses volatile and atomic operations, internally). This map doesn't need to support multi-threading operations - it is always used in a single-thread manner. Other optimizations are possible, due to the limited way this table is used.  One of the common cases is an iterator fetching an existing FS from the CAS, and needing to supply the corresponding JCas object (if it exists).  This operation first looks up in the Map using the address as the key, and if not found, then makes the JCas object, and then adds it to the map - an operation which repeats the same lookup in order to find the "empty slot" where it can store the item.  This extra lookup can be eliminated.

texts:CDE add type button and other actions broken
Users reporting the add new type button doesn't do anything.  Another user reported problems with Edit button.  Cause traced to a different ordering in some cases of when widgets are created and handlers are called, probably caused by the changes done when migrating to Apache.  Each dialog has 2 areas: the main contents, and the button bar at the bottom with OK and Cancel.  The order of widget construction seems to be 1st: main contents, and 2nd: button bar.  If the main contents sets some fields which causes the "handlers" to run for UI events, the button bar OK button is getting enable/disabled according to dialog logic, but it hasn't even been instantiated yet.  Fix is to check button bar OK button exists before calling enableOK methods.  In the process, refactoring the code slightly to move this logic to a common spot in super class where possible.

In large multithreaded deployment with many annotators, measurements showed large slowdown in class loading as 100's of annotator classes were loaded, perhaps in 100's of instances.  Each load operation locked 1 shared global lock.  Java 7 implements a finer grained locking for this, so that the lock is per [ classloader + class-name ], to reduce lock contention.  This code will need to be conditional for Java 7 and later.  See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/lang/cl-mt.html

texts:Ducc Agent logs excessively when cleaning up on startup
When an Agent starts up it tries to cleanup the node  of running processes that are associated with cgroups on the node. It reads pids of these process from each of active cgroups and kills them via -9.All of this works fine except if there is a zombie process. This is a process that is dead but still appears in the OS process map. In this case the cgroup exist and the process is still associated with it. Killing such process with -9 has no effect as the process is already dead. The bug is that the agent goes into an infinite loop waiting for the zombie to go away and worse yet, it keeps logging at 200ms intervals.Add detection of zombies and prevent logging.

Modify agent to detect a defunct (zombie) process. When one is found, change the state of the process to CROAKED and remove from inventory to mark it as rogue. The defunct processes appear to be running from the Agent's point of view as the process never exited thus the Agent continues to wait in the process.waitFor() and also consumes stdout and stderr. The only remedy for this is to bounce the agent since there is no way to kill the defunct process which is still owned by the agent.

For cas pools, getCas returns a handle to the InitialView of an empty CAS,and stores this handle to match in releaseCas. This breaks for services that employ sofamapping. The empty CAS is filled from a serialized CAS sent to the service. It is possible that a CAS received may not contain the view, CAS.NAME_DEFAULT_SOFA, specified by sofamapping.Then, when the service tries to return the CAS to the pool, releaseCas blows up at the first line,CAS cas = aCas.getView(CAS.NAME_DEFAULT_SOFA);so the CAS is not returned to the pool ==> CAS leak.The cas pool should be storing references to the base CAS, which is independent of views.

The orchestrator currently records to its log some limited and incomplete information about synchronization.  This improvement:1. Instruments all WorkMap synchronizations in the OR2.

Records all pending requests when current holder releases having held synchronization for > 10 secondsThis is to address the situation, for example, where OR is running albeit slowly.  Newly added log messages will hopefully shed light on where the bottlenecks may be.One theory is that a normally fast resource, such as the filesystem, becomes very slow and bogs down OR while its trying to write its checkpoint dataset.  In this case, we'd expect to see the synchronization lock held for a long time by the OR's checkpoint module.

A Job of 300,000+ Total work items failed with Reason Premature after processing 70,000+ of them.The Job Driver (JD) maintains a file in the user's log directory named work-item-status.json.gz comprising the information shown by the WebServer on the Work Items tab of the Job Details page.  As each work item is processed, the JD's WorkItemStateManager (WiSm) maintains an in-memory representation for Id, Node, PID,  State, Start and End times.  Periodically, the JD employs the WiSm's export method to re-write the above file.Although the amount of information is relatively small per work item, when the number of work items is large the amount of memory consumed is large since these in-memory representations are kept for the lifetime of the Job.To alleviate this "designed-in" memory leak, the WiSm should only keep  active work items in-memory.  Terminal work items should be flushed to disk.  This change will affect DUCC components that employ WiSm, specifically CLI, WS and JD.

This code removes those from the string value returned by UID().  This means that 2 different UIDs that differ only in having some part have a minus sign, could be confused with another not having this.

The UIMA-AS JmsAnalysisEngineServiceStub contains a static Map which holds a reference to a shared UIMA-AS client instance.

There are a number junit tests that test different scenarios where JmsAnalysisEngineServiceStub  is used. The first such test succeeds but subsequent ones fail with Exception "Uima EE Client Not in Running State". This is caused by the fact that the static Map in JmsAnalysisEngineServiceStub is not being cleared when each test is done. It contains a stale reference from the previous junit test. This stale reference has been stopped and its "running" flag=false causing the above mentioned exception.There is also another problem related to the lifecycle mgmt of the shared uima-as client instance. In the current code, the shared instance is stopped   when destroy() method is called. This method is called N times, where N= number of AE instances. So on the first destroy() call, the uima-as client is stopped leaving the client in !running state. Subsequent invocations to sendAndReceive will fail again with above mentioned exception.

texts:Allow multiple iterators in different threads to read the CAS
Some applications scale out on multi-core machines by using CAS Multipliers.  Sometimes, it makes sense when the new CASes have a lot of identical data, to have the common part of these in another CAS which can be set up and shared (read-only) by other threads.  Unfortunately, this design suffers from random failures in the CAS iterator code.  Figure out what's wrong and fix this, to start supporting read-only CASes being accessed simultaneously in a multi-core platform on multiple threads.  Include a JUnit test case, too, if possible.

The process still had its cgroup intact as it was still running.The rogue process detector while looking for rogue processes checks if a process belongs to a cgroup. If it does, the detector assumes that this is a valid process and not rogue.The detector should not check if the process belongs to a cgroup while determining if its rogue or not. Any process that does not have ducc as its ancestor should be treated as rogue and reported as such for subsequent cleanup. Exception to this are processes belonging to users with reservations on the node.

texts:support multi-threaded shared contexts for CasPools for CAS Multipliers
The current UIMA framework design is quite flexible when it comes to producing analysis engines (AEs), to allow various scale-outs on a single JVM. When scaled out, via multiple instances of the AEs, it's possible to have the multiple instances share the UIMA Context (by passing a reference to it in additional params). The current design for CAS Multipliers creates a pool for each CAS Multiplier, and hangs it off of the UIMA Context.  The problem with this approach is that if the scaleout approach chooses to share a common UIMA Context with all scaled out instances, then the CAS pool will run out of CASes.  A better design is to hang the pool off of an object that will scale with the Annotator itself, rather than the shared context.  This can be done by changing the implementation of getEmptyCas() in the CasMultiplier_implBase class(es).  The current implementation calls the same method on the (potentially shared) UIMA Context object; this could be deprecated with a note saying that this will still work, but not with scaled out impls that share the UIMA context object.

texts:Classloading inconsistencies
The type discovery mechanism relies on Spring tech and eventually on org.springframework.util.ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader() which tries the following classloaders: Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() ClassUtils.class.getClassLoader()This allows it to override the classloader used for type scanning by setting the thread classloader.However, when we actually instantiate components, we rely on UIMA tech which uses: getUimaContextAdmin().getResourceManager().getExtensionClassLoader() Class.forName(annotatorClassName)In particular, it does not look at the thread context. To make classloading consistent, it appears that uimaFIT should check if there is a thread classloader and configure it as the extension classloader for UIMA components created via uimaFIT. Because uimaFIT is using mainly static methods, respecting the thread classloader appears to be the most sensible thing. At least better than setting a global classloader.To give some context: I hit this problem when running a uimaFIT pipeline from a Jython script. The first problem was to allow uimaFIT to properly scan the JARs in sys.path of the script context, which I did by setting the thread classloader. After that, I tried to run a UIMA component whose class I had defined in the script. UIMA was not able to find the class for this component:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "./bad.jpy", line 39, in <module>    runPipeline( at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.initializeAnalysisComponent(PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.java:209) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.initialize(PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.java:158) at org.apache.uima.impl.AnalysisEngineFactory_impl.produceResource(AnalysisEngineFactory_impl.java:94) at org.apache.uima.impl.CompositeResourceFactory_impl.produceResource(CompositeResourceFactory_impl.java:62) at org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework.produceResource(UIMAFramework.java:269) at org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework.produceAnalysisEngine(UIMAFramework.java:387) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.asb.impl.ASB_impl.setup(ASB_impl.java:255) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.initASB(AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.java:429) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.initializeAggregateAnalysisEngine(AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.java:373) at org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl.AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.initialize(AggregateAnalysisEngine_impl.java:186) at org.apache.uima.impl.AnalysisEngineFactory_impl.produceResource(AnalysisEngineFactory_impl.java:94) at org.apache.uima.impl.CompositeResourceFactory_impl.produceResource(CompositeResourceFactory_impl.java:62) at org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework.produceResource(UIMAFramework.java:269) at org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework.produceResource(UIMAFramework.java:314) at org.apache.uima.UIMAFramework.produceAnalysisEngine(UIMAFramework.java:425) at org.apache.uima.fit.factory.AnalysisEngineFactory.createEngine(AnalysisEngineFactory.java:204) at org.apache.uima.fit.pipeline.SimplePipeline.runPipeline(SimplePipeline.java:73) at org.apache.uima.fit.pipeline.SimplePipeline.runPipeline(SimplePipeline.java:115) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483)org.apache.uima.resource.ResourceInitializationException: org.apache.uima.resource.ResourceInitializationException: Annotator class "org.python.proxies.__main__$Writer$1" was not found.

texts:DUCC SM should support timestamps to identify idle services
The Service Manager's ping/monitor protocol should support a mechanism to provide identification of services that are started and using resources, but which have been idle for a "long time".  The mechanism should enable identification of idle services and a mechanism to turn off the services under site policies.The proposed mechanism is for the ping/monitors to support a "last use" timestamp which indicates the last apparent use of the service.  Display mechanisms such as the web server would use this to identify unused or lightly-used services.  The mechanism also should enable ping/monitor support to automatically stop idle services.  The Service Manager's start-by-reference mechanism is then used to start the service if some job later needs the service, with the only loss being the time needed to initialize the service.The mechanism should also enable the ping/monitor to re-enable the service's persistent running state if it determines this is needed.The proposed mechanism for this second step is to allow the ping/monitor to enable or disable the service's "autostart" flag.

texts:Modify DUCC to deal with out of order messages
Its been observed that an Agent killed a JD immediately after starting it. This happens rarely but does occur.Looking through the Agent log I see that multiple OR state updates arrive almost instantly. In one of the states the OR requests a new process to be started while in the second state the process doesnt even exist. So the agent first launches the process and then subsequently kills it as this indicates a ghost process. A ghost process is one that exists in the agent's inventory but is not present in the OR state update.This is happening due to out of order messages. The OR generates its state updates at regular intervals (every 20 secs) and sends them to a jms topic. In this case, the PM fetches the update, trims it and sends it to agents. Not 100% sure, but it looks like there is some kind of a delay in a broker which causes messages to be held and than subsequently delivered in rapid succession. The agent should be able to cope with this. The OR should add a sequence number to each state it publishes. The PM should forward this sequence when it sends a trimmed state to the agents. The agent should compare received sequence against what it received on the previous  update.If the new sequence is larger than the previous one, processing should be allowed. If the new sequence is smaller then previous, the message should be discarded.

texts:DUCC Agent accumulates Camel Routes Leading to OOM
When an agent launches a new process it creates a Camel route to collect stats (memory usage, cpu, etc). The route is added to the Camel context where it remains for the lifetime of the agent. When the process is stopped, the agent only stops the route but never removes it from the Camel context. Over time these routes accumulate and eventually cause Agent OOM.When the process is stopped the agent should remove associated route from Camel context.

The code which decides whether or not the map table expansion is needed does if (size >= sizeWhichTriggersExpansion) {      increaseSize();but fails to then recalculate sizeWhichTriggersExpansion... Additionally, the technique to save the last failed probe located empty cell is unreliable, because arbitrary user code could be run which might disturb this value, in the case where a new JCas cover class instance was constructed, and the class defined a "readObject()" method - this would be called and could execute aribtrary operations.

texts:Adding (J)CasUtil.selectCoveredSingle()
JCasUtil (and its equivalent CASUtil) have two very useful methods: selectSingle(JCas jCas, Class<T> type), retrieving all T type annotations from the CAS, making sure only one exists, and returning it selectCovered(JCas jCas, final Class<T> type, AnnotationFS coveringAnnotation), retrieving all T type annotations from the CAS, that exist in the span defined by the covering annotation.My request is to add a selectCoveredSingle method (I already implemented and tested, written below). It would retrieve all T type annotation in the span of the covering annotation, make sure there is only one, and return it.The uses for such a method would be really common, as this assists in performing something very basic in UIMA - once you have some annotation, you want to retrieve other information on it, and if it is a small unit, then you know in advance that many types of information should only appear once for that annotation. Otherwise, it's an error.For instance, say I have linguistically annotated text, and I hold some intersting annotation of a Token. Then I want to find out what is its Part Of Speech. Then I would simply call: selectCoveredSingle(jcas, PartOfSpeech.class, token), and get exactly one PartOfSpeech annotation as I expected. If there is none or more then one, an exception is thrown.One could also use a method like selectCoveredSingleOptional (not implemented yet), that does exactly the same, but returns null when no such annotation exists, instead of throwing an exception. This makes sense when a token can have some optional attribute. In linguistics, it could be when a Token may be a NamedEntity, but not necessarily.the implementation is made out of two methods - the first should be in JCasUtil, the second should be in CASUtil.===Implementation:=== /** Get the annotation of the given annotation type constrained by a 'covering' annotation. Iterates over all annotations of the given type to find the covered annotations. Does not use subiterators.  * @param <T> the JCas type. @param jCas a JCas containing the annotation. @param type a UIMA type. @param coveringAnnotation the covering annotation. @return the single instance of the given type. @throws IllegalArgumentException if not exactly one instance if the given type is present under the covering annotation. @see Subiterator  @author Ofer Bronstein @since April 2014  */ @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") public static <T extends Annotation> T selectCoveredSingle(JCas jCas, final Class<T> type,   AnnotationFS coveringAnnotation) {  return (T) selectCoveredSingle(jCas.getCas(), JCasUtil.getType(jCas, type),    coveringAnnotation); } /** Get the annotation of the given annotation type constrained by a 'covering' annotation.

texts:solidify the non-modification of additionalParameters passed to core sdk apis
Many user-facing public APIs make use of a map for passing in additional parameters.  This map is also used internally.  The API contract for this is mostly that the map passed in is not altered. But occasionally, the framework augments or changes the map internally.  This causes failures if a user passes in a non-modifiable map, or depends on the map having the same contents when the method it was passed into , returns.  Most places in the UIMA Framework code already copy the map if they're going to modify it.  Find the places where this is not yet done, and make those places also copy it.

texts:DUCC Agent should not try to remove cgroup when kill -9 fails to stop a process
When an agent starts up it tries to clean up the node. It first waits for the OR publications and then checks the node for running processes. It then reconciles what is running against what should be running (using OR state). Any processes not in the OR state should be evicted with kill -9 and its cgroup removed.If there is a defunct process on a node, it cannot be killed. Such process still has associated cgroup which cannot be removed. Its been observed that the agent's attempt to remove the cgroup of a defunct process causes the CPU utilization to spike for a couple of minutes.Agent should detect if a process is defunct and not try to remove its cgroup

texts:Add more logging to Ducc Agent
Add additional logging to the Agent code to help diagnose why an Agent doesnt launch processes. This is rare but it does happen. The agent receives OR state, sees a new process and begins to launch it. The log shows that the last line logged in the launch sequence is just before the Agent tries to check if a cgroup with a given id exists. When the agent is in this state no processes are spawned.There is some evidence that the problem may be related to the OS problems. When the agent had trouble launching processes, it was observed that running a simple  command like "rm" was taking a couple of minutes.The agent tries to determine if a cgroup exists using File.exists(). My hypothesis is that this call may block if the OS is in a bad state.

texts:Memory management problem with compressed binary deserialization
We think we stumbled across a memory management problem with the new compressed binary serialization when a CAS is reset/reused in a loop, e.g. in the uimaFIT SimplePipeline. When we use form 6, we consistently run into out-of-memory situations. Finally, we took the time to do a heap dump analysis.We found a huge TypeSystemImpl instance in the heap (~450MB). What makes it huge is the field "typeSystemMappers"that in our case contains 1000+ entries, each of them using apparently using a TypeSystemImpl as key.It looks like typeSystemMappers is never reset when a CAS is reused. My current theory is, that it should be reset when CAS.reset() is called, otherwise type systems accumulate there when the binary deserialization is used to repeatedly load data into a CAS in a loop that is resetting and reusing the CAS.

This is important if the pseudo-nodes are used in ducc.nodes e.g. to define nodepools and classes over the test configuration.This change introduces a new optional key into the simulation configuration, 'index'.  The index is associated with each real node and resets the counter used for name generation.  For examplenodes = node1 node2index.node1 = 5index.node2 = 20When generating pseudo nodes on node1 the counter is reset to 5; on node2, the counter is set to 20.

Recent optimization and error reporting changes in CasManager_impl in the 2.6.0 uima-sdk uncovered a uima-as aggregate bug in code which tries to merge type systems from delegates where one of them is a remote CM. See UIMA SDK JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-1249The new uima sdk code complains if addMetaData method is called after CasPool is created. It turns out that the UIMA-As aggregate creates a Shadow CasPool for its remote delegate CasMultiplier before the type system is merged. Fix is to move the code that creates Shadow CasPool beyond where the merge occurs. After successful merge create the Pool.

texts:Switching to use correct class loader
The current design presumes one classloader is used for all components in an application.  This shows up in the implementation when using JCas - the class loader used to load the JCas cover classes is set up in the CAS, and there is only one there.  This works, unless the analysis engine component is loaded by a different class loader.  This causes strange class-cast exceptions, where the source and target classes look to be identical (what's happening is that the classes are named the same, including having the same package names, but are loaded with different class loaders).  A fix is needed that insures the class loader used for JCas can be switched when an analysis engine component is run.  This should be time-efficient because the flow controller could be under a different class loader than the delegates it's controlling, so the class loader could be switching back and forth twice per delegate dispatch.A proposed approach is to add an internal method to the CAS, useClassLoader(xxx), which will be called by the framework just before the processCas call, passing in the class loader that was used to load the analysis engine class.  The framework will check to see if this is the current in-use class loader, and if it is, do nothing.  If it isn't, if the JCas is instantiated, it will call a new JCas method, switchClassLoader(xxx). This method will (a) reset the cache JCas uses to reduce object creation for JCas objects, and do what's needed to load or switch to the right set of iterator generators.  Where possible, re-loading will be avoided, to make the switch fast.

Below is the stack trace. Thanks> very much for your help,>Most control characters are not allowed in XML 1.0, even if they areescaped with &#xxx.  If your input document contains such characters,the XMI CAS serializer is writing them to the output XMI document,making it unreadable.I checked that if you edit the XMI document and change the first line to:<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>The problem goes away, because XML version 1.1 does allow escapedcontrol characters.So one possibility for us to fix this in UIMA is to have the XMI CASSerializer generate XML version 1.1 tag by default.  (I think weconsidered that before and decided not to for some reason, maybe wewere worried that other applications might not be able to consume XML1.1?  I can't remember. Another possibility would be to have the XMI serializer automaticallyreplace these characters with spaces.  The XCAS (not XMI) serializerdoes that, but only for the document text, not for feature values.  Wecould also serialize the XMI using XML version 1.1, which allowsescaped control characters (but still not the 0x00 character).

The DUCC CLI currently constructs a new NodeIdentity object as part of initialization.  The NodeIdentity iterates all network interfaces trying to find all the ways "me" is identified.  The CLI then uses only the "getIp()" method which returns exactly the results from InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress();.The problem is that iterating all those interfaces can take a long time and if there is a mis-configured or otherwas errant NIC the pause can be significant, on the order of minutes.This JIRA is to track changing the CLI to use InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress(); directly instead of NodeIdentity for this purpose.  Initial testing indicates a significant improvement in interactive response.

Hi,As the Ruta documentation mentions, "writing rules that contain a first rule element with an optional quantifier is discouraged and will result in ignoring the optional attribute of the quantifier." A solution for overcoming this is to declare a rule element as a starting rule element by adding “@” directly in front of it. Thus, I am using ruta rules likeToken??{REGEXP(Token.posTag.value, "At")} // ArticleToken??{REGEXP(Token.posTag.value, "Aj")} // Adjective@Token{REGEXP(Token.posTag.value, "No")->MARK(Chunk, 1,3)}; // Nounto mark nouns and optional pre-modifiers before them as chunksHowever, the rule seems to match only Adj Noun sequences and not to match input like:anArt|At anAdj|Aj aNoun|NoThanks for looking into this.

If the annotations involved are nested, the result has extra line feeds and lots of extra white space (corresponding to the indenting of the nested xml elements produced by the CasToInlineXml).

The html version of the CAS Viewer (as used by the Document Analyzer, if you select html as the format) uses Javascript to display annotations in the right-side pane on mouse-over, and resets this when the mouse moves out of the item on the main pane.The reset is done using the frame's document, via doc.close() and doc.open().   This clears the annotation pane OK, but the open() causes a History record to be created.   This is compounded by the fact that a word may be covered by many annotations, and there's one of these clear actions for each covered annotation.  So if you have 6, moving out causes 6 resets, and 6 additions to the History.  This rapidly make it appear that the "back" button is broken...Use a different reset method to avoid overloading the history list.

This causes more subtractions than additions and the share count falls negative, rendering the cluster unschedulable.Fix is in NodePool.nodearrive(), be sure to alwasys increment shares in all cases of a node returning.

texts:sofa2jcasMap not be consistenly set
While researching the fix for UIMA 386, found that the mechanism for adding entries to sofa2jcasMap was not happening for the case of aCas.getView(somenewsofa).getJCas().  This would cause a duplicate JCas to be added, when there already was one.  As part of the research for fixing this, see if the map can be eliminated (in favor of using the sofa2tcasMap followed by getJCas on that).

texts:UIMA-AS allows multiple calls on defineCasPool() which results in an exception
The UIMA-AS uses a custom thread pool to enable pinning of threads to specific AE instances. This is needed to enforce a design where a thread used to initialize AE instance is also used for calling process() on that instance.The thread pool is plugged in to the jms listener (for the input queue). The pool is configured with a fixed number of threads (=scaleout factor). Due to a bug in the uima-as failover code, a thread (from the pool) was exiting (due to connectivity problem). The problem was replicated by using a bad broker URL on the top level service.Since the thread pool was told to maintain a fixed number of threads, the exit of a thread caused a new thread creation and subsequent attempt to initialize another AE instance which then led to a call to defineCasPool() again. The uima core doesnt allow multiple calls to define cas pool and throws an exception.

Given 2 or more services, say, A and B, where service A depends on service B, then service B is an independent service.If service A is started, service B is then started by reference if needed.  If then service B is stopped, the reference (incorrectly) attempts to start B confusing state, and leaving service be "stuck" in Stopping state (which is then persisted and B is permanently broken until a manual update of the service meta data is performed).The fix is to bypass reference-starting a service which is marked as "stopped".  Note that this leaves the dependent service A potentially unusable; in this case service B must be manually restarted to get the dependency chain working again.

Although it is possible to modify any service registration parameter, it can be difficult to undo an update to one of the pinger-related parameters - i.e. revert to the default.  The ideal operation is simply to delete the modification, not to re-modify the pinger with another value.  The answer is to allow the value of an option under --modify to be 'delete', in which case the SM simply removes it from the service registration.This is implemented only for pinger-related operations.

texts:add alternative int - int maps, and int sets for better space/time performance
int - int maps and int sets are implemented in UIMA as either red-black trees (size = 5 words (4 words for sets) + 1 bit per item, search time = log 2 size (binary search), insert /removal can cause rebalancing tree), or as intVectors (like ArrayList<Integers> but doesn't wrap ints as Integers).For int - int maps, add a hash version (loses key "ordering"), which takes 3 - 6 words per item (avg 4.5 words - slightly smaller), and has O(1) performance (based on existing JCasHashMap impl, but without concurrency support).For int sets, add 2 styles: one based on the same hash map (space = 1.5 to 3 words per item vs 4 words), the other based on BitSets.  The BitSet one would be faster, would have a conventional key ordering, and would be smaller, if the max int stored < 128 * number of items stored.  (This is often the case in uses where it is used to track Feature Structure addresses).Finally, add one adaptable int set that is usually is implemented as a BitSet, but if the items being stored are such that the size would be significantly larger than the IntHashSet implementation, switch to that alternative representation.

Change the data structures used for this to use Int2IntHashMap, and change the way values are store to be ints, not Strings.  This should improve space and time for Xmi and Json serialization.

changed files:uimaj-core/src/main/java/org/apache/uima/flow/impl/FixedFlowController.java
texts:Reduce unneeded fixed flow controller sync contention
The Fixed Flow Controller is designed to allow one instance to be used by multiple copies of a UIMA pipeline, initialized from the same context.   In this case, only one initialize call is done; the others are no-ops.  The instance contains one update-able ArrayList - the list of delegates.  This array is normally only "read", but there are two defined interfaces to allow dynamically altering it (addAnalysisEngines, and removeAnalysisEngines). The current impl of this is a synchronized list.  For the 99.99% of cases (reading), this sync is not necessary, and causes some observable sync contention.  Change this to a non-sync'ed "CopyOnWrite" implementation, to avoid this contention.  The downside is that current Flow objects in use while after this call occurs will not see the update, but new ones will. This is probably a good thing, because it seems that incorrect flows might occur if this was changed while flows were in-progress.  The documentation currently says these methods are not currently called because UIMA doesn't support dynamically adding or removing analysis engines to/from an aggregate.

While working Json serialization, I noticed an unexpected listing of subtype information which was eventually traced to the built-in array types having a wrong supertype.  This is due to a bad initialization ordering - the part which sets up the supertype for the built-in array types was depending on some initialization which hadn't happened yet.Fix by moving the initialization done later into the main type system setup code.  I verified that via adding a test case to TypeSystemTest that this is a very old error - it existed in the code back in 2008 while still in the incubator - in 2.2.1-incubating release.

When annotations are removed from indexes, sometimes they come back... the following test case shows how an annotation is removed but still present when iterating over the index later.    @Test    public void testForZombies() throws Exception    {        // No zombie here        int[] offsets1 = { 0, 4, 5, 11, 12, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 35, 36, 40, 41, 50, 51, 60, 61,                64, 64, 65 };        testForZombies("Dies flößte Friedrich II. für seine neue Eroberung Besorgnis ein.", offsets1);                // Zombie hiding in here        int[] offsets2 = { 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35 };        testForZombies("Ich bin Franz III. von Hammerfels !", offsets2);    }    public void testForZombies(String aText, int[] aOffsets) throws Exception    {        // Init some dictionaries we ues        Set<String> names = new HashSet<String>();        names.add("Friedrich");        names.add("Franz");        Set<String> suffix = new HashSet<String>();        suffix.add("II.");        suffix.add("III.");        // Set up type system        TypeSystemDescription tsd = new TypeSystemDescription_impl();        tsd.addType("Token", "", CAS.TYPE_NAME_ANNOTATION);                // Create CAS        CAS jcas = CasCreationUtils.createCas(tsd, null, null);        jcas.setDocumentText(aText);                Type tokenType = jcas.getTypeSystem().getType("Token");        Feature beginFeature = tokenType.getFeatureByBaseName("begin");                // Create tokens in CAS        for (int i = 0; i < aOffsets.length; i += 2) {            jcas.addFsToIndexes(jcas.createAnnotation(tokenType, aOffsets[i], aOffsets[i+1]));        }                // List the tokens in the CAS        for (AnnotationFS token : jcas.getAnnotationIndex(tokenType)) {            System.out.printf("Starting with %s%n", token.getCoveredText());        }        // Merge some tokens, in particular "Franz" "III." -> "Franz III." and "Friedrich" "II."        // into "Friedrich II."

texts:Ruta: MultiTreeWordList with Feature-based Output
Sometimes I need a feature-based output of multi-tree wordlists instead of a type-based output.For instance, at present it is possible to specify different types for matches against different dictionaries likeDocument {->TRIE(  "dict.L0" = L0,  "dict.L10" = L10,wl, true, 0, false, 0, " .-/")};which creates annotations of type L0, L10 for matches according to dictionaries dict.L0, dict.L10. Additionally, it should be possible to specify (types and their) features for the output like, e.g.,Document {->TRIE(  "dict.L0" = {Terminology_A, id, "0"},  "dict.L10" = {Terminology_B, code, "10"},wl, true, 0, false, 0, " .-/")};which should create annotations of type Terminology_A/B and set their feature id/code to the value "0"/"10" for matches according to dictionary "dict.L0"/"dict.L10", respectively.

texts:fix JSON tests which do XML compares to use XMLUnit
The JSON tests have a mode where they generate xmi/xml serializations as well, just for extra coverage.  THe compare of these against expected can't be a string "equals" because different XML parsers, transformers, etc. do ordering of name-spaces and formatting of empty elements differently.  Use instead the XMLUnit package (available from Maven Central - license OK) (thanks to suggestion from Richard Eckart de Castilho), to check for "equality" instead that allows for these differences.

It looks like Apache JIRA has a bug returning a max of 100 jiras when creating a jira report. Ducc 1.1.0 has a total of 188 jiras, so 88 are not in the report. Even when running a query directly in JIRA, one gets only the first 100.A workaround is to run the query manually in JIRA, let it return the first 100 than change query parameter value of tempMax to 200. Temporarily disable changes plugin in ducc's top pom to stop generating partial report. Add manually generated report to svn so that the build can pick this up and include it in the tar and zip files.

texts:improve int set utility impls
The PositiveIntSet impl has a bug in the ordered set iterator (not incrementing an index in a loop).  In addition, Improve this also by eliminating expensive operations on bit Sets (such as computing the number of elements in the set), and augmenting the IntBitSet to allow a potentially much smaller footprint, by supporting an "offset" for the use case where there's a lot of fairly "dense" members, clustered at an offset from 0.  Increase the hysteresis for switching among alternative impls in PositiveIntSet. Add (approximate) tracking for IntHashSet of mostNegative as well as most positive. Do some other minor cleanup - making things appropriately private / final.  Add / update test cases.

Recognize that the underlying formats typically do "doubling" of the space used, and add a fast-path if an add operation won't trigger this. Enhance the interface so it can be used for the FSBagIndex underlying impl, replacing IntVector, in order to support UIMA-3399.

This is nice feature and very powerfull, however there is no way to plug my own WORDLIST/WORDTABLE implementation, for example WORDLIST that find matches in database table or in  lucene index etc...I think that the WORDLIST/WORTABLE implementation can be defined as UIMA external resource, in resources section, and then pass a reference to WORDLIST/WORDTABLE in ruta script. The other option is to specify the class that implements WORDLIST/WORDTABLE to RutaEnvionment and instantiate it in ruta environment using Reflection.

The most common use of the CLI is by calling its main() from within Eclipse, with the user's application classpath.  If the classpath contains pointers to 3rd party packages used by the CLI, and comes before uima-ducc-cli.jar, the CLI can malfunction.Similarly, uima-ducc-cli.jar is often left in the classpath for other than DUCC CLI usage, and it's own use of 3rd party packages can interfere with applications.To remedy this we remove as much 3rd party usage as possible, and use a classloader for the rest to provide 2-way protection.

There is an issue with UIMA's JCasGen & FindBugs 2.0.3Whenever a Type is defined and JCasGen generates the Java bindings for it, findbugs will report a high importance issue with the generated code, pertaining to the lines: /** @generated  @return the generator for this type   */  @Override  protected FSGenerator getFSGenerator() {return fsGenerator;}The error is the one below.In short, getFSGenerator() is called in the constructor of the superclass of the generated *_Type.java class, and getFSGenerator() is overridden in the subclass. This is a findbugs trigger in the above version.Superclass is Annotation_Type.java, see here: http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.uima/uimaj-core/2.6.0/org/apache/uima/jcas/cas/AnnotationBase_Type.java#AnnotationBase_Type.getFSGenerator%28%29Line 76 is the place where the call is made that triggers the findbug.However, getFSGenerator() in superclass is :    protected FSGenerator getFSGenerator() {     return fsGenerator;   }and this is overridden to protected FSGenerator getFSGenerator() {return fsGenerator;} in *_Type.javaSince this is the exact same code, I see no problems in removing this (the lines commented out in the diff), which fixes findbugs:http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.apache.uima/uimaj-tools/2.6.0/org/apache/uima/tools/jcasgen/JCas_TypeTemplate.java?av=f#68remove from the String literal this part:"/** @generated \n   * @return the generator for this type\n   */\n  @Override\n  protected FSGenerator getFSGenerator() {return fsGenerator;}\n"

texts:Reorganization of TypeSystemImpl, CASImpl, FSClassRegistry, adding new CASMetadata class
Prepatory to work on supporing multiple classloaders, this change reorganizes several classes as follows:1) following a suggestion by Thilo, added the CASMetadata class: holds "final" refs to a TypeSystemImpl instance, and a FSClassRegistry instance; also holds structures derived from these used by the CASImpl in doing its work.  There is now just one instance of FSClassRegistry per instance of CASMetadata, and one instance of CASMetadata per instance of TypeSystemImpl.2) TypeSystemImpl had a set of package-private variables holding instances of some built-in Types and TypeCodes.  So did CASImpl.  These are now consolidated into one spot - the TypeSystemImpl.  3) Creation of a new TypeSystemImpl object loads it with the UIMA Built-in types.4) The CASImpl class has a new inner class called SharedViewData; all CASImpl fields which are shared by all views are stored here.  The only things not in this inner class are things related to the index repository, the mySofaRef, and the JCasImpl ref corresponding to this Cas View.  The shared view data replaces a previous strategy of copying things for each view.5) The JCas now shares all generated JCas cover objects among all views.  The cover object has a particular view instance, which is updated, as follows:  "new": the view used to create it;  De-reference: the view associated with the referring object; Iteration: the view containing the index being iterated over. 6) Following a suggestion by Adam, changed the generators to ignore what's in the JCas _Type objects, and instead use a standard generator.7) Several issues around Sofas and Views were cleared up - these were potential bugs that could happen if users used old APIs in unusual ways.8) JCas class loading is changed to load once per "class loader", and share these across all "views".  However, there are still individual _Type objects per view, per the discussion in the uima-dev list.

texts:moveTo(fs) where fs > all items in index is broken
Using moveTo(fs) where the fs is beyond the last element in the index incorrectly sets the iterator position to the 1st element.  It should set the iterator to (from the Javadocs) ""insertion point" for fs, i.e., to a point where the feature structure at that position is greater than fs and the fs at the previous position (if it exists) is less than fsWhen the fs is > all the elements in the index should conceptually set the iterator to 1 past the end of the index, which isValid() will return "false" for. Although this change may break user code (in case users have worked around this), it's important to have this operate correctly.  If this turns out to be an issue, we can later issue a patch that removes this fix under a JVM property flag, something like uima.jira_4094.keep_old_behavior.UIMA-1601 introduced this behavior (8/19/2011).UIMA-1601 was about moving to the left-most of equal FS hits in the index.  It did this in the PointerIterator, but that impl is not used if the index being iterated over has no subtypes.  Move this fixup code to the impls that LeafPointerIterator uses.  It uses one of 3 - one for bag, set, and sorted indexes.  The bag is a don't care - there are no "keys" and no notion of left-most.  The set uses the CompIntArrayRBT which has a comment saying it does already the right thing (I didn't test).  The sorted uses IntVectorIterator which has the problem.  Move the (fixed) code UIMA-1601 added from the PointerIterator to the IntVectorIterator, to insure it always returns the left-most one (among equals).

texts:moveTo for bag index incorrectly setting position to 0 if not found
The bag index implementation for moveTo(fs) sets an invalid iterator position when the new PositiveIntSet impl is being used.  moveTo(fs) doesn't really have a good meaning for bag indexes, since there's no "key" to use in comparing.  But the current impl does a "reasonable" thing of a) moving to the == identical FS if it exists in the index, or (it tries to ) move to the first one.  Change the impl to actually moveToFirst() if not found, so it works also with the PositiveIntSet impl.

Unfortunately, this check misses checking the many other paths that are used to add a FS to an index.  For instance, the path when using JCas: instance.addToIndexes(), and many others.Fix this by moving the test downwards to the place where all code paths flow together.  Allow restoring the old behavior in case needed, via a JVM -D parameter: uima.disable_enhanced_check_wrong_add_to_index

texts:deserialization of delta CASes broken in some cases
Delta CAS serialization includes attempting to handle changes made by a remote "below the line" - changing existing FSs.   If the remote removes the FSs and re-adds them back to the indices, this fact is sent back with the delta CAS as a list of FSs that are "re-indexed".  The deserialization takes this list, and removes them, and re-adds them back to the indices in an attempt to get them properly indexed.  However, this doesn't reliably work, if any of the keys used in the indexing were updated. Furthermore, there is nothing that insures a remote remove/add FSs it is modifying.  Perhaps the remote is unaware that FSs of that type are even being indexed (the information about what indices are defined at the client is not sent to the remote). So, it is possible that the remote could modify some feature, which is used as a key by the client.   The Deserialization would update that feature, without removing the FS from the indices first.One conclusion - the list of "re-indexed" FSs returned by the remote during a delta serialization is not a reliable indication of which FSs would need reindexing, since the index definitions between the client and the remote could be different.One fix: for mods to existing FSs, remove the FS from the indices in each view, do the mods, and then add them back (if they were previously found in the indices for that view).  Some optimizations: for subtypes of AnnotationBase - only one view need be checked.  The remove could be skipped if none of the slots being updated are in use as keys in some index; this might be an expensive check, though. This is a problem for all implementations that support Delta CAS:  Xmi, Binary, BinaryCompressed types 4 and 6.

When running the tests with mvn install target, Maven has it's own class loading framework (classworlds) so the classpath that is used for the pear verification does only containg the jar files for the classworld class loading framework but not the UIMA test and runtime classes. To fix this issue the PEAR verification code must be modified/changed so that the UIMA extension class loading is used to verify the installed components. The same fix should be applied when testing the installed pear with the CVD GUI that can be started from the PearInstaller GUI.

texts:Change how default bag indices are created
UIMA-173 added the concept of a universal default bag index for types that would be created if no other index was defined for that type.  That Jira has a link to the motivation, where it is clear that this was intended to simplify how UIMA works and allow all feature structures that were addedToIndexes() to be retrieved. UIMA-297 corrected some anomalies in the original implementation.This Jira is to correct the edge cases that happen when there are only Set indices defined for a type.  Because of the behavior of Set indices whichdo not add to their index the 2nd or subsequent FSs whose key values match the comparator definition for the Set, the original motivation of the default bag index is thwarted in this case.  This has caused several edge case issues; a special note about this surprising behavior had to be included in the UIMA documentation, etc. More recently, another edge case has been discovered, when an annotator contained in an aggregate having sufficient index definitions to insure a non-set index for type T is remoted, and that remote service has only a Set index for type T.  Assume that the client has added-to-indices 100 instances of type T, the CAS is serialized to the remote, the remote deserializes the CAS and does 100 add-to-indices, of which perhaps 50 succeed, and the other 50 are no-ops (due to the Set equivalance).  Now when the remote CAS is returned, only 50 will appear in the index back at the client.  This goes against the principle in UIMA where we try and have remoting of components not affect the semantics, where possible.  This is also quite a surprising effect, which won't be expected by most users.  This is also an "unstable" effect, in that, if a pipeline "assembler" (knowing little about the "internals" of the components) were to add a component to the remote which included a non-set index for type T, it would start behaving differently, not losing any indexed items. The converse would also be true: If the remote had no indices defined for type T, then add-to-indices for type T would be recorded in lazily created default bag indices, and those events would be sent back to the client. If an assembler were to now add a component which contained only a set definition for type T, this behavior would suddenly start dropping FSs that were excluded due to the Set comparator. For all these reasons (discovered in discussions with Edward Epstein and Adam Lally), and because of the original intent of this default bag index (discovered by reading the mail archives pointed to by the above two Jiras which describe in some detail the motivations for this), this Jira changes the logic of when the default bag index is created to create it whenever the situation is that some add-to-indices event would not record an addition (e.g., if there were no indices, or only Set indices, and the FS matched elements already in the Sets.).This change will affect documentation, so update that too.  In particular, the NOTE in this section http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.6.0/tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae.reading_results_previous_annotators will no longer apply.The behavior of getAllIndexedFS(type) will change - it will no longer have an exception for the special case where only Set indices were defined for the type.Because it seems that it is extremely unlikely that the previous behavior was being depended upon, there is no global flag to restore the previous behavior.

In Javascript, if you have an hash (map) object  in a variable, e.g. "cas", you reference the value of a key using {{ cas&#91;"keyname"&#93; }} or, better: {{ cas.keyname }}.  For the 2nd form to work, keyname must be a valid Javascript name.  Names like @views are not valid.  So change these to forms e.g. _views which are valid.

texts:if allow_duplicate_add_to_indices, delta CAS needs to remove all
UIMA-4100 fixes an issue around Delta deserialization - when updating an existing, indexed FS, by removing the FS from the index before updating the feature values, and then adding it back.  If the JVM property uima.allow_duplicate_add_to_indices is defined, then it's possible the FS may be added to the indices multiple times.  To prevent index corruption, in this case, loop the remove-from-index operation until it fails to find the item in the index, so it removes all instances.  And when re-adding it back, add it back the same number of times it was removed.

texts:support for modifying indexed FSs
Both users and the UIMA framework (during deserialization of CASes in XCAS, XMI, or various Binary formats) may want to modify a feature in a FS which is used as a key in some index specification.  If this FS is in the index, then indices which use this feature as a key may become corrupted, unless the FS is first removed from the indices.  After that, the feature may be updated, and the FS re-added to the indices.If allow_multiple_add_to_indices is enabled, a particular FS may be added to indices multiple times; the above remove operation would need to remove all of these, and the above add operation would need to add-to-indices the same number as was removed.The count of the number of times a FS was in the indices needs to be kept by View.There are several optimizations possible for this operation.  Bag indices do not need to be disturbed as they have no keys.  Set indices only have at most one instance of a particular FS.  FSs which are subtypes of AnnotationBase are only indexed in at most 1 view (the view of their sofa).  The remove-all kind of operation for Sorted indices can be made efficient in that all the identical elements are stored adjacently, and the remove can be done in bulk.The update operations for one FS may involve multiple key values.Design a way to encapsulate the update operation that is efficient, for both users and the UIMA framework, supporting both a try-finally approach and an encapsulation via a Runnable.For example, for try - finally:AutoCloseable ac = cas.protectIndices();try {     ... user code ...} finally {   ac.close();}or, with a Runnable (written in Java 8 lambda style):cas.withProtectIndices( () -> {    ... user code ...});

While putting in support for deserialization of delta CASes which update existing FS which may be indexed (thus needing special handling to avoid potentially corrupting the index), I noticed what appeared to be a kind of copy-paste error - where a wrong FS feature offset variable was being used.This would only ever show up if form 6 was being used and the source and target type systems differed in a manner that led to different offsets in the FS for the affected kinds of features.  The affected kinds are: byte, boolean, float, and string, and arrays of float and string.  The typo was that the heap update was using the cas-being-deserialized'd feature offset, instead of the cas-being-deserialized-into's offset.  Other kinds were correct.

FSIndex objects are returned to the user when they get an index from the index repository.  FSIndex objects support methods like size(), iterator(), contains() and find().size() and iterator() methods consider the index to contain instances of a particular type and all of its included subtypes. However, the implementation of the contains and find is such that it only searches the defined type of the index, excluding any elements which may be in the index, but are a subtype of the type of the index. I'll check in a test case which shows this behavior. The question is: should the docs be updated to describe the impl, or should the impl (for find and contains) be updated to run over the subtypes that might be in the index?

This is now possible due to the change to add default bag indices (no need to merge "set" indices), and if allow_duplicate_add_to_indices is not specified.  Eliminate this extra overhead in that case, and also use "bulk" methods where possible that avoid iterating and use things like System.arraycopy to accumulate the results.

texts:improve serialization warning for multiple-refs
The 2.7.0 common serialization code has new checking to see if something being serialized in the xmi special format for arrays and lists is declared not-multiply-referenced (and therefore can be serialized as an XMI special list), but actually has multiple references (and therefore should not be serialized as an XMI special list). The message says what the system will do - it will serialize them as if they were multiple separate items.  Unfortunately, for large CASes, this message could occur very frequently, for essentially the same error, thus overflowing disk allocations, etc.  Figure out a way to give the message without "flooding" the output.

I think we'restuck with the American spelling now ... I don't see any 'indices' in the2.6 docs.4.5 in References shows how to use protectIndices but perhaps shouldinstead link to the larger discussion in 5.6.410.2 in References describes -Duima.report_fs_update_corrupts_index butdoesn't give an example of the report message, or what to search for in thelogs.When describing uima.protect_indices_from_key_updates perhaps say that whenfalse it acts like pre-2.7.0 and corruption is not detected  (is thiscorrect?)  Presumably avoiding the check saves some CPU ... significant?In the README Index Corruption section it might help to add a little morecomparing the three ways to deal with it ... let UIMA fix it, or explicitremove/add, or protect block.  Also would help to say what to look for inthe logs. Or simply refer to the References section.

texts:simplify iterators to avoid type merging juggling when order is not needed
Users who use getAllIndexedFSs(type) to iterate over all FeatureStructures of a particular type, in no particular order, for types which have subtypes, use the PointerIterator implementation which juggles the collection of iterators for each subtype and "merges" them in the proper order.  This is done even when the index type is a BAG.  Add an alternative implementation which does the much simpler thing for these cases (where order isn't needed) that avoids the juggling operations and just goes through each index sequentially.

Couldn't find any way to catch this exception in a reliable manner.  Solution is to set the sys.excepthook method to a custom method that deals with the problem.  In this case, it's ok to simply ignore the exception so it doesn't spew to the console, disconcerting the user.  The test for this is to pipe the output of ducc_process_submit into 'head', which reads a few lines and then closes its pipe even if ducc_process_submit isn't completed.

The javadocs say that in this case the lower level setting is set according to a global LogManager configuration setting.  In many cases, it's null, which causes the level to be inherited from the parent.  But it might not be.

When items are removed from the IntHashSet, special "placeholders" take their place (and take up a slot in the table). When the table needs expanding due to the load factor, the copying into the new table will drop these placeholders, thus "reclaiming" the space.  Resizing is triggered by the size + nbrRemoved exceeding the load factor.  If the nbrRemoved is >= size, then keeping the same size table (instead of doubling it's size) will bring the load factor down to what it would have been in the absence of removes, when the table size was doubled.  Change the reallocate to keep the size in this case (but still do the copying - which cleans up the removal placeholders).

texts:Client hangs with more than 1 time-out
The client hangs if the execution has two time-outs. After debugging into the issue, we figure out that the resending mechanism has some bugs in it. Here are the detailed description.Please review the necessity for the invocation of sendCAS(). In our system, we don't have to resend the CAS to process again. Please provide a configuration so that we don't have to resend the CAS every time there is a time out.Whenever there is the first time-out, BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl#notifyOnTimout() is invoked and it hangs when it tries to invoke sendCas() at line 2385. I believe the reason is that the sendCAS() is a synchronized method and a potential threading issue causes this thread hang over there. Please be noted that this block is also synchronized.Then when there is a second time-out, it will be hanging in the very beginning of the method notifyOnTimeout() and cannot clear the time-out CAS from the CAS list, which hangs the entire client.

The current class constraints are per-allocation and not sufficiently constraining in that a user can dominate a cluster with many requests for non-preemptable shares.There are proposals for user-based limits (max allocations per user), group-based limits (group membership determines limits), and project-based limits (submission to authorized projects determines limits).The final decision is still open.  This JIRA will track progress and eventually, the implementation.2015-03-06Consulting with actual users, the preference is for user-based as it is simplest to understand and administer.  The current plan is to implement a "max GB per user by class" scheme where, if the class so designates, the maximum allocation per user for a class is configured. GB is to be the unit of allotment, as the unit "share" is variable by installation choice/need, and "process" is variable by hardware in a heterogeneous environment.  A user registry will allow overrides for designated users.  As well an class-inclusion mechanism is to be implemented which, if configured, will restrict use of classes to specific users.  If no limits or inclusion is configured for a class, all users will be permitted unrestricted access to the resources governed by the class.

Increasing this makes (for large allocations > 2 million) for more wasted space, since, on average, about 1/2 of the last reallocation may be unused  On the other hand, having a large allocation size increment means that fewer reallocations are needed (each one requires copying the entries from the old into the new, usually with System.arraycopy).Given the drop in memory cost, increase the reallocation switch-over limit for the 2 million entries to 16 million, to rebalance a bit more in favor of speed vs memory.  Note this has no effect except when the size of these internal tables grows beyond 2 million entries.

texts:testing utility MultiTrheadUtils not getting intended parallelism
The MultiThreadUtils routine in the core UIMA testing code is intended to run multiple threads of tests in parallel.  It was doing this by creating some number of threads, and starting them.  The intent was that these threads run together, and experience some contention.When measured on a 2 GHz Intel i7 Windows machine, the time to start the thread seemed to be about 1 millisecond.  Which meant that unless the test took longer than a millisecond, no contention would happen.  Change this to have the threads all "started", but then wait for a "go" notification, given after all threads have completed their startup.

texts:Gradually shrink internal core arrays on reset actions
Many internal core data structures composed of arrays (typically of ints) expand as needed while running.  When a reset event occurs (e.g., cas.reset()), many of these are cleared, but not "shrunk".  So the effect of running, say, one Document which is very large might cause many internal data structures to expand, and from then on consume potentially large but unused space.  This isn't too bad an issue with modern OSs; except for movement in the heap, it would be expected that the pages containing the unused space would gradually be paged out.Nevertheless, it would be good to gradually shrink these spaces back down after some peak.  The shrinkage should be gradual, to avoid needing to expand the arrays too often.  I think a good rule of thumb would be to remember one previous size, and to shrink only if both previous sizes were small enough to be contained in 1 size shrinkage.This should reduce oscillating back and forth around a particular size, while recovering space over many "resets" from an early abnormal expansion.I'm thinking that the 1 size shrinkage algorithm should run the expansion algorithm backwards - that is, in many of our data structures, expand by doubling up to some switch point, and then expand linearly by adding.

texts:Speeding up set iterators
It is now trivially possible to speed up UIMA Set iterators which are iterating over a Type have subtypes, by changing the interator from one which is constantly computing the "next" element by looking at the sort order the current iterator and other iterators over other (sub)Types, to one which simply returns all the elements of 1 (sub)type, and then goes on to the next (sub)type.This would be a behavior change, in that elements returned would no longer be in a sort order.  However Set Indexes are documented to not have an "order" (see section 2.4.1.5 in the UIMA Reference, where it says:  "Set indexes do not enforce ordering, but use defined keys to specify equivalnce classes; addToIndexes will not add a Feature Structure to a set index if its keys match those of an entry already in the index."If users accidentally rely on sorted ordering among a Type and its subtypes for sets, then this change will violate that constraint.  If many people use this current property of UIMA Sets, it may not be a good thing to do this change.

Measurements are showing some tuning is needed in buffer sizes for the binary compressed serialization/deserialization code.  Reducing one buffer from a max of 32k to 1k showed a speed up in deserialization of more than 2.5 x using an IBM JVM on an Intil i7 with 128K L1; using a Oracle JVM - there was a minor speedup.  This effect appears to be due to L1 cache flushing/dumping. Check and tune both form 4 and 6.

texts:Ruta: HTMLConverter: Option to convert tags outside body tags
The HTML converter only converts tags that are found inside the body tag. Therefore some information carrying tags like citations get left out when applying the converter to XML articles with many metadata. It would be useful to add the option to have all tags converted since this would allow content outside the body to be parsed by natural language analysers as well.The converter was originally, as the name implies, conceived for HTML documents but together with the HTML Annotator it can this way be more generally useful in enabling NL parsing of a broader class of documents such as articles stored in XML documents.An example of how this option might work can be given by disabling the "inBody"-flag inside the HTMLConverterVisitor. The example also illustrates what offsets to apply to such annotations but otherwise the document annotation offsets can be used. Empty tags can still be ignored but tags with only attributes and no content should preferably be converted.Experiments with disabling the "in body"-constraint reveals that there will be an additional need to separate the content metadata tags in the converted text view. An NL parser reading the text will in many case read different tags as one word or one sentence, which is not desirable. Some text delimiter should therefore be inserted between tags were required, which optionally could be customizable as well.

Add generic mechanisms to the Indexes and iterators to support Iterables whose elements are JCas types. Update the APIs that get indexes over particular types to allow specifying those types by the type class, and use this for generic typing, so casts are not necessary for user code.Make the generics work also when JCas is not in use.

This update is a short-term fix and will be replaced after a bit of research into how best to automate the solution.

texts:DUCC CLI: Different results with different JRE
So far this only affects the service API/CLI, perhaps because it is more complex than the others.The net is the API produces ClassNotFound exceptions under Oracle 1.7 JREs and later, but work in all other (IBM and Apple-supplied JREs of all tested vintages).Everything works under IBM JREs but the fields that are initialized by initializes in the declarations in the returned objects are initialized a bit differently; in particular, at least one string field is initialized to null despite being declared like this:String foo = "N/A";  If the field is updated as part of executing the CLI in the SM it is returned correctly.Only the query was working in the Oracle JREs.  Other SM APIs returned ClassNotFound for the base class returned by the query that works!An older JRE produced by Sun works the same as the IBM JRE.I believe this is a discrepancy and possibly a bug in the Oracle JREs.The "solution" was not to change the DUCC classloader but instead to declare the returned API objects to look fully like Java Beans with no-parameter constructors and getter/setter methods.  It's unclear why this matters but any port in a storm ...

texts:index contains and find methods incorrect when index type has subtypes
The Javadocs in FSIndex (the general interface for UIMA index implementations) has two methods, contains(FeatureStructure) and find(FeatureStructure), which state the obvious definition.  UIMA Indexes are over some Type and its subtypes.  The current implementation of these methods only check the topmost Type of that index, and ignore subtypes.  So, for instance, if you have an index over type T, and add-to-indexes a subtype of T, and then ask if the index contains that one, implementation only checks the top-most "type", and incorrectly returns false.  Find also fails in the same way.

texts:create auxiliary flattened version of index and its subtypes, automatically managed
UIMA indexes allow retrieving items from the CAS, trading off space (for indexes) for time (speed of finding items in the CAS, speed of iterating).  For sorted indexes over a type with subtypes, if the index isn't being modified, it is possible to do a one-time extraction in sorted order of the items and save this in an array, and iterate much more rapidly over that. I've seen lots of cases of UIMA flows where some annotators will create and index a type (and its subtypes), and once that's been done, the indexes are not subsequently updated for these types, but downstream annotators iterate over them.  It seems that a lazy creation for this kind of flattened index would work well in many cases.It is important, I think, to continue to preserve the same kind of ConcurrentModificationException detection.  To make this additional index space-time trade-off automatic and reasonable, make the additional index reachable via a SoftReference, to allow the GC to reclaim the space if needed.  Delay the creation of a flattened version until there's evidence that it will be unmodified for some time.  To count things that motivate its creation, count the number of times an iterator over an index is using the code "heapifyUp/Down" that manages the ordering of the subiterators to preserve sort order.  A basic indicator may be the number of times that occurs, without an intervening update to the indexes, relative to the size of the index.The flattened array can save a bit more time by holding references to the Java cover class (JCas or non-JCas) for this object. Cas Reset needs to clear out these things.

texts:Annotators are not prevented from calling CAS.release()
Annotators are prohibited from calling CAS.reset() but not CAS.release().Since release() in turn calls reset(), previously this was effectively prohibited as well.  However, Marshall undid that in his recent work - making release() "unlock" the CAS prohibited functions.This was done to allow CAS Mutipliers to release the CAS - which we currently say is a best practice when an error occurs in a CAS Multiplier.So I think CAS Multipliers need to be allowed to call release() on CASes that they obtain from the CAS pool.  But analysis components (either annotators or CAS multipliers) should not be allowed to release() CASes passed to their process() methods.

texts:DUCC JP does not return initialization status of AE
When AE initializes a JP starts a thread to collect initialization status of components. It uses JMX to poll AE Management MBeans to fetch state and init time. This seems to work ok for UIMA-AS deployments but is not working for Pieces'n Parts. The jmx ObjecName constructed by the JP uses the following string: org.apache.uima:type=ee.jms.services,* to query. But for Pieces'n Parts deployements the AE MBean the object name is different:  org.apache.uima:p0=DUCC Job. Change the query string to  org.apache.uima:* to unify query across different deployments.

texts:UIMA-AS service bloats metadata on each GetMeta request
Everytime a client sends GetMeta request the UIMA-AS service bloats metadata by adding AEInstanceCount parameter. This parameter is added only for informational purposes to let the client know how many AE instances are available for processing. DUCC Service Manager process sends GetMeta requests frequently to many services it manages and over time service metadata becomes large enough to cause OOM in the SM.Modify UIMA-AS to add the parameter only once.

Improve image scaling.  FOP 0.20.5 ignored scale=, but FOP 0.93 supports it.  Switch the docbooks to 0.93 FOP.  Add support to adjust PDF scale so it is expected size (not huge).  Review and adjust all imagedata specs to work with 0.93 FOP (eliminate sizes in pixels, FOP using a different presumption about this).  After this, it should be possible to specify no size or scaling and have things work, or to specify the size in some fixed dimension for PDF output (like inches) - it will be scaled for html output so it looks the same size, or to specify a scale= parameter.

texts:subiterator edge case needs correction - begin value with multiple instances
The definition of a subiterator requires that the FSs returned by strictly greater than the bounding FS (greater-than is with respect to the sort order for Annotations).  The current implementation makes two mistakes - it uses the "equal" method on the FeatureStructure - which returns true only for the indentical FS (same heap address in same heap), and doesn't allow for multiple occurances of annotation-index-ordering-equals items.  For example, if there were multiple "Tokens" each of which had different non-indexed field "lemma" which were set to different values, and one of these FSs was used as the bounds, then the iterator incorrectly currently skips over that one but only if it happens to be the first one in the sort order, and never skips the others which would also compare equal (using the annotator comparator). The correct behavior is to skip over all until an item is found which would compare as not-equal-using-standard-annotator comparer.

texts:Subiterators - avoid copying
The current subiterator implementation starts by copying into a list all the valid values of the iterator; it then iterates over this.Change this to avoid copying in many cases.  Do the copying (converting to a list form of only valid FSs, and the previous implementation did) only when required (to support moveTo(FS) with unambiguous, reverse movement with ambiguous,  moveToLast (for all styles).  After conversion, the iterator will work as in the previous implementation, including not supporting ConcurrentModificationException (CME) signalling; before conversion, CME is supported (this is a behavior change).

texts:UIMA Sets have contradictory aspect - document this
While examining the CasObj implementation, I was surprised to notice that the comparator for Set indexes always included a "types-are-the-same".  I looked at the test case for this, and saw some contradictory things.1) You can ask an index to compare (using its defined comparator) two feature structures.  1a) If you define an index to compare feature A, and you make two instances of a Feature Structure with the same A value, but one is a subtype of the other, the myIndex.compare(fs1, fs2) will return 0 (indicating they are "equal" for the purposes of the comparator.  1b) If you define the comparator to compare feature A and use type priorities, then the compare will not be 0 (because the types are different).2) back to the first comparator - just on feature A.  If you add-to-indexes the two FSs, the 2nd one, even though it "compares" equal to the first using the index's comparator, will still be added to the indexes; the size() of the index will be 2, not 1.This is long-standing behavior, so I'm reluctant to change it.  It is caused by a detail of the underlying implementation, where the index is actually kept as "n" separate indexes, by type, so the Type and the SubType are in two separate indexes.My feeling at this point is to update the documentation to correspond to this detail of the implementation.  Other thoughts?

The location of the files is decided by TestPropertyReader.getJUnitBasePath().  Since Maven requires (or at least strongly encourages) loading resources through the classpath, I hacked up getJUnitBasePath() to do a ClassLoader lookup on a dummy resource and return the directory in which it is found.  This ought to be cleaned up at some point.2) grep for TODO in src/test/java in both uimaj-core and uimaj-cpe.  There are many things that need to be addressed.

texts:intermittent failure - uima class loader with multi-threads
Eddie found that a simple pipeline he wrote using an OpenNLP aggregate, for a DUCC test, occasionally failed with a certain combination of Java's, machines, data-being-processed.  (It was pretty rare).  The failure was java.lang.LinkageError: &#8211; the java class that was trying to be loaded --, and, for the failing Java, no other details (other than the stack trace.  The failure only happened if the OpenNlp aggregate was scaled out to run on multiple threads.Cause was traced to a small detail documented here in Java 7 info on implementing Multithreaded ClassLoading: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/lang/cl-mt.html .The UIMA Class loader was changed to support parallel class loading for Java 7 and beyond.  The problem is that the implementation didn't notice that the class loader using this facility has to have a mechanism to insure that "the protected defineClass() method is called only once for each class loader and class name pair."  The UIMA class loader fails to do this, and I think that's what's causing this issue.

Add a standalone tooling for migrating v2 JCas classes to V3 style, while preserving any customization that may have been done.Initial approach:  command line tool, inputs are file system "roots" which are searched for either .java or .class files, recursively, including within Jar files.   For all that are likely JCas classes (use various heuristics, including if there is a paired ..._Type class), migrate the source form.     If starting with .class files, decompile those first to get the source form.       The migration consists of first parsing the source into an AST (Java Abstract Syntax Tree), and then having a view visitor methods to modify selected parts of the tree, including getters/setters and the 2-arg constructor. The migration tool should also report summaries of what it did, and handle things like multiple instances (including identifying which of these are ignorable because the files are all the same, and which have differences - so the user can decide).

texts:class cast exception in CasAnnotationViewer
The CasAnnotationViewer has a long-standing issue - it doesn't properly handle the displaying features which are built-in arrays (except FSArray), if the CAS being viewed is a JCas style Cas - a class cast exception happens. This problem predates the changes introduced in UIMA-3374, but is present there too.  Prior to UIMA-3374, the CasAnnotationViewer did not activate the JCas, and the DocumentAnalyzer (a main caller of this viewer) always passed in a non-JCas CAS, so things worked.  The changes in UIMA-3374 activated the JCas (it did a cas.getJCas()), and this exposed these previously present errors which generate class cast exceptions. These errors are caused by code that presumed a non-JCas style of CAS, and did casts that depended on this. One instance of this is the line StringArrayFSImpl arrayFS = (StringArrayFSImpl) aFS.getFeatureValue(feature);which generates a cast exception if the JCas is being used.  Scan the code to find any other instances of an assumption being made of the kind of cover class.

texts:Flatten indexes need to be invalidated when switching to JCas
uima 2.8.0 introduced automatically-generated "flattened-indexes", created after measurements of use indicate it would be beneficial to replace iteration over a type with (lots of) subtypes, with a flattened version of that index.  These flattened versions hold the Java cover class instantiation of the instances.  If these are created before JCas is used, then the cover classes are the non-JCas ones, e.g. FeatureStructureImpl or AnnotationImpl.  After the JCas is used, the generators are switched to use the JCas ones.A problem occurs in this case: JCas is not used, a flattened index is created, JCas is activated, and then an iteration is done over the flattened index.  This iteration will return the non-JCas versions of the cover classes, potentially causing class cast exceptions.The fix, I think, is to invalidate any flattened indexes that might exist in all views, the first time JCas use is started.

The normal envisioned use case for the cas copier is1) make an instance of the cas copier, specifying the two CASs2) do an operation (copy a cas, copy a cas-view, copy some FSs)Some users are in a sense reusing the cas copier instance; they make an instance, and then copy some FSs, and then maybe copy a view.  The general contract for the CasCopier instance is that it "remembers" what FSs have been copied, and doesn't copy them again. There was an optimization that tried to speed up the isDocumentAnnotation test - the casCopier instance remembers what the srcCasDocumentAnnotation is, once it's looked up.  Unfortunately, each view has its own; there was code to re-look it up but it wasn't being set for all possible user invoked paths.  Note this is only an issue for use cases which are using the same casCopier instance both for copying individual FSs and for copying views.

There are some edge cases that invalidate the flattened indexes, that are not accounted for.  One is what happens when a pipeline transitions from non-JCas to JCas generators.  Any flattened index built before this transition will have the incompatible kinds of Java Cover classes. The other happens within a PEAR context - during that part of a pipeline, the classpath is altered, and the PEAR could be redefining the Java cover classes.  There may be others.  For now, because measurements in real-life situations didn't show much if any improvement, the fix is to disable this feature.

The CAS interface has to say this about the sofa feature's full nameFEATURE_FULL_NAME_SOFA = "uima.tcas.Annotation:sofa";However, when I try to use this to filter out the sofa feature, I don't catch it - and the reason seems to be that the sofa feature is actually defined asuima.cas.AnnotationBase:sofa... at least that's what the debugger says.

Right now, the RutaBasics are not cached in the CAS. Therefore, all the internal information in beginMap, endMap and partof needs to be recreated for each call of an Ruta analysis engine. Investigate how this problem can be solved or relaxed.Some ideas (brainstorming): wait until annotations in UIMA are represented by a normal java objects try to enforce caching the relevant FSs (RutaBasic) store the information in features (the normal CAS way) add an extra index (can it be injected in order to avoid the problems with type priorities?) use an external resource (the probably most unnatural way)

Extend agent cgroup sanity check on startup to include a test for existence of CPU control. Users my forget to add cpu in their cgconfig.conf and start cgroups with no CPU control. The agent should call cgset and disable cgroups on failure. Agent should keep the state of cgroup in memory and log it at some interval to make sure this info is not lost. Currently the agent logs the state of cgroups (enabled/disabled) at startup only. When agent logs roll over this is lost. Modify agent node metrics logic to dump the cgroup state at regular intervals.

texts:ruta-maven-plugin misses qualification of names when importing by name
The resource names in the descriptors generated by ruta-maven-plugin have no name qualification at all when importing resources by name. The package names are ignored. I've created a new Maven project. Added /src/main/ruta as source folder and put the scripts therein. There's no Java involved. The project was deployed with Maven and referenced by a Java UIMA project. Because a variant of the CPE builder from uimaFIT is used, all imports must be by name (The desciptor file of the UIMA aggregate is temporarily written to the systems temp folder). Resource resolution fails. But adding the name qualifications manually solves the issue, e. g. prepending org.apache.uima.ruta.engine to BasicTypeSystem or the project's package names to the generated resources.

The twl goal takes a file from a folder specified in the pom and generates a word list in twl format. That file is always written to the top of the resources folder for generated resources. But it should be written to a subfolder of the resource folder reflecting the package structure.For example, if the simple list file resides in src/main/resources/my/package the corresponding twl file is written to target/generated-sources/ruta/resources. But it should be written to target/generated-sources/ruta/resources/my/package.This is very important for projects with many dependencies where different resources from different packages but with the same name can occur.

The agent tries to access /proc/PID/statm and also tries to collect metrics via JMX from a process that may no longer be running producing exceptions in an agent log. The process metric collector runs at regular interval in a dedicated thread driven by a camel timer route. There seems to be a race condition when a process exits and before an agent can change its internal state, the metric collector thread attempts to access statm which is no longer in there.When an exception is caught, check the state of the process and if it is not running dont log an exception

texts:Need getViewIterator() method to work with a variable number of views
Based on user feedback, a common design pattern is for an annotator to want to process a set of Views in a CAS. Currently user code can do this using getSofaIterator() and testing each SofaFS to see if it matches the requirement. A simpler approach is to have a new method:  Iterator getViewIterator(viewname)where viewname represents a Sofa name prefix. As with Sofa mapping, this API would return all views with names matching viewname.*. Sofa mapping would be respected, so "viewname" could be mapped.

Feature Structures have IDs; these show up in externalized formats.  In v2, these were the int heap address. In V3, these are incrementing ints, starting at 1.Support is needed for PEARs and for low-level createFS methods to hold onto FSs to prevent them from being garbage collected.  This is provided using a map from IDs to the FS.

texts:UV3 improve JCas feature id use for index corruption checking and journaling
When setting (changing) values for features, sometimes index corruption checking needs to be done, and sometimes changes need to be journaled.  Both of these need to identify the feature involved.  This operation should be fast and memory-cache-friendly (e.g. not involve following a long chain of dereferencings).  Add static final fields that represent features used by a particular JCas class, which have names derived from the short-feature-name, and won't collide with other names, and set these using the same JCasRegistry mechanism to unique values within a class loader.  This allows the same JCas cover classes to be used with different type systems.  Change the corruption testing logic to use BitSets and have a version which uses these indexes as well as one which uses the FeatureImpl featureCode.  Keep one extra table mapping these codes to FeatureImpls, per type system.

texts:UV3 XMI serialization / deserialization
Update XMI serialization and deserialization. Because the new Feature Structure (FS) model has constant things as Java "final", they need to be known at FS creation time (e.g., the sofa reference for subtypes of AnnotationBase, the associated casView is also a final constant).  Sometimes the order when deserializing has the sofa FS following their use.  Implement a deferral method for these situations (using Java 8 lambda techniques where appropriate) to reorder creation as needed.  The same issue arises when deserializing feature values which are references to other FSs not yet deserialized.Change the xmi serialization to serialize the sofas first, to avoid needing to use the deferred FS creation logic.

The CAS.java file defines many static final string constants corresponding to built-in type names and features.  One of these, the FEATURE_FULL_NAME_SOFA is supposed to define the full feature name for the sofa feature introduced by the type AnnotationBase.  The full feature name starts with the type name of the type which first introduces this feature (first in the top most type in the type hierarchy).  The definition says this type is Annotation, but should be AnnotationBase

texts:Creating CASs with common CAS Definition should share type systems
Cas Definitions can be captured in the class CasDefinition and passed to the CasCreationUtils createCas methods.  This is done, for instance, when CAS Pools are created.  The processing currently holds the definitions as description-objects, and re-parses these into type system implementations, every time a cas is produced.  These multiple type systems are identical, but replicated, which is wasteful.Change the definition of CasDefinition to permit it to hold the derived TypeSystemImpl object, and change createCas to use that if available, to share common TypeSystemImplementations.Other approaches that result in even more instances of type system sharing might be considered, but it's possible that different instances may be wanted in some cases in the future (for example, if we allow dynamic augmentation of types / features while running).

Right now I will have to maintain my own copy of the default seeder without the MARKUP initialisation but obviously this is not desirable. One solution is to split the seeder in two seeders with both added as default and another solution is just to add an additional token seeder without MARKUP to the library, which can then be used optionally to replace the default seeder. The latter solution would probably benefit that the common code of the two seeders is shared somehow to make sure the implementations are always in sync.

texts:Log messages for duplicate resource declarations have their arguments switched
If you declare two resources with the same name, you get a log message:The external resource named {0} has been declared multiple times with different definitions. \  The definition of the resource in component {1} will be used.  The definition in component {2} will be ignored.However the code that generates the message has the arguments {1} and {2} the wrong way around, actualy it is the resource declared in component {2} that will be used.The same is true for the log message about overriding resources - it tells you that the resource declared in the aggregate was overriden by its delegate, which is the opposite of what actually happens.

texts:DUCC Job Driver (JD) neglects to set current thread classloader
From Burn:I think the problem is that when the DUCC JobDriver runs the user'sCollection Reader code using the user's classpath it does not set thethread's context class loader.  I suspect that the code you're calling isusing the thread's classloader to load names.txt.A work-around (until the next release) is for you to set it in your CR tobe the same as the one that loaded your CR before calling the code thatloads names.txt, e.g.Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(this.getClass().getClassLoader());Note that if any user code uses the system classloader it may fail sincethat uses the classpath that started the JVM which will be the DUCCclasspath.

texts:errors in plain binary cas delta serialization of short/long modifications to arrays
(Found by code reading, needs test case) The code in class CASSerializer for handling long/dbl value modified cells in arrays while doing delta serialization appears to have a some copy/paste kinds of errors. The first (line 583) attempts to get the collection of modified addrs in the long heap,but gets the "short" rather than "long" addrs.  The second (line 587) writes the address of the modified value using a writeShort, which both silently fails if the value is > 32767, and only writes 2 bytes, while the corresponding "read" (in CASImpl after comment "//modified Short heap" reads the addresses as an integer.  This makes all reading after this off by 2.This same kind of error (writing the address as a short) also appears in the handling of modifications of shorts (line 570).Fixing this will result in writing more bytes to the serialization stream, so the streams won't be "compatible".  Therefore, do some kind of incrementing of versions and serialVersionId values to signal to readers this format change.  Updating this for client/server pairs will require updates at both ends.This bug causes failure of deserialization, if any short or long array values are modified and delta serialization is being used, so needs to be fixed.Added a new test case to check this area and found another issue: the rounding to word boundaries while serializing delta changes to byte and short arrays was incorrect.  Fix that as well.

texts:sofa mapping not set properly for flow controllers
A user reports the following problem:  an inner aggregate (IA) is contained within an outer aggregate (OA) the OA has a sofa mapping specifying that initial view be mapped to "my_view" (MV). IA has components A1 and A2, plus a flow controller (IA_FC).A1 and A2 correctly receive MV as the cas view, via sofa mapping.  However, IA_FC does not - it receives the _InitialView.When an aggregate is set up, there are two sofa mappings to consider; one is the calling context's sofa mapping (if any) up to that point; and then there is the aggregate's own sofa mapping from its descriptor.  This 2nd sofa mapping specifies, for each delegate, a set of sofa mappings.  In addition to mapping for delegates, it can also contain a mapping for the flow controller.The intended operation is to set up sub-contexts for each delegate or flow controller, that has the merge of the calling context's sofa mapping and any mapping specified for the component.  This merge is done, for example, in UimaContext_ImplBase method "createChild".  This logic is missing for the analogous creation of the context for the flow controller.  The fix is to (a) pull out this bit of merge logic into a subroutine, and do it in both the creation of the Annotator context, as well as the Flow controller context.Test the fix to see if it fixes uima-as use case (if uima-as has this same issue).

We are currently setting the parameter reloadScript to true in our RUTA engines so the dictionaries reload without us having to restart the service.But we have some external engines, invoked from RUTA scripts, which create connections to other servers, and until now we have been storing this connections as class instance variables in our external engines so they can be reused and the engine doesn't need to create a new connection for every document processed. And the initialize method checks whether the engine instance has already an open connection, so no matter how many times the initialize method is invoked only one connection is established.But if we invoke this external engine from a RUTA script that has the reloadScript parameter set to true, a new instance of the engine is created for every document processed, and therefore a new connection to the remote server will be established for each document too, regardless of the check for an existing connection in the initialize method.So for external engines that store some sort of state in instance variables, it would be great if RUTA only created one instance when the reloadScript is set to true.

The component CL would have access to the message bundle, but InterationalizedException uses it's own classloader (the higher level one that knows about Core UIMA) to load message bundles:// locate the resource bundle for this exception's messages         // turn over the classloader of the current object explicitly, so that the         // message resolving also works for derived exception classes         ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(               getResourceBundleName(), aLocale, this.getClass()                     .getClassLoader());Thread [main] (Suspended (exception MissingResourceException))  owns: PrintWriter  (id=92)  owns: ThrowableInformation  (id=93)  owns: ConsoleAppender  (id=94)  owns: RootLogger  (id=95)  ResourceBundle.throwMissingResourceException(String, Locale, Throwable) line: 1564  ResourceBundle.getBundleImpl(String, Locale, ClassLoader, ResourceBundle$Control) line: 1387  ResourceBundle.getBundle(String, Locale, ClassLoader) line: 1082  AnalysisEngineProcessException(InternationalizedException).getLocalizedMessage(Locale) line: 240  AnalysisEngineProcessException(InternationalizedException).getLocalizedMessage() line: 218  AnalysisEngineProcessException(Throwable).toString() line: 480  String.valueOf(Object) line: 2994  PrintWriter.println(Object) line: 754  Throwable$WrappedPrintWriter.println(Object) line: 764  AnalysisEngineProcessException(Throwable).printStackTrace(Throwable$PrintStreamOrWriter) line: 655  AnalysisEngineProcessException(Throwable).printStackTrace(PrintWriter) line: 721  DefaultThrowableRenderer.render(Throwable) line: 60  ThrowableInformation.getThrowableStrRep() line: 87  LoggingEvent.getThrowableStrRep() line: 413  ConsoleAppender(WriterAppender).subAppend(LoggingEvent) line: 313  ConsoleAppender(WriterAppender).append(LoggingEvent) line: 162  ConsoleAppender(AppenderSkeleton).doAppend(LoggingEvent) line: 251  AppenderAttachableImpl.appendLoopOnAppenders(LoggingEvent) line: 66  Logger(Category).callAppenders(LoggingEvent) line: 206  Logger(Category).forcedLog(String, Priority, Object, Throwable) line: 391  Logger(Category).log(String, Priority, Object, Throwable) line: 856  Log4jLogger_impl.log(Level, String, Throwable) line: 272  PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.callAnalysisComponentProcess(CAS) line: 417  PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.processAndOutputNewCASes(CAS) line: 308  PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl(AnalysisEngineImplBase).process(CAS) line: 269  PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl(AnalysisEngineImplBase).process(JCas) line: 284  AnalysisEngine$process.call(Object, Object) line: not available ...The IMHO best way would be if UIMA would at try here to use the thread's context classloader - and maybe that UIMA actually sets the thread context classloader to the resource manager CL while running components... in my case, I already do that outside UIMA atm, so searching the thread CL would be sufficient for me atm.See also: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-3692

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted serialized Java Message Service (JMS) ObjectMessage object to execute arbitrary code on the system.Fix for this is in 5.13.release. Upgrade UIMA-AS to the latest version (5.13.1)

texts:uv3 Supporting Delta deserialization requires preserving simulated heap addresses
UIMA supports various formats of delta deserialization, which is when a serialization is done (to, for example, a remote service), and then a delta serialization returns just the changes back to the original CAS.  There are two approaches used to get the set of FSs to serialize.   One way, used for plain binary and form4 compressed, scans the "heap" sequentially, and sends all those FSs, including potentially FSs that are not "reachable". The other way is to use the indexes plus following reference chains to locate all "reachable" FSs, and only send those.  This is used for XCAS, XMI, JSON, and Form6 compressed.In V3, the plain and form4 serialization need to preserve simulated heap "addresses" (per CAS) for the FSs sent in order to enable future delta deserializations to have the proper "heap" addresses; it may not recalcuate this from the CAS FS contents, because intervening GCs may have garbage collected some unreachable FSs..  Furthermore, plain and form4 non-delta deserialization where a delta serialization is to follow, must likewise preserve these simulated heap addresses (per CAS), for all deserialized FSs.This preservation is needed to insure that the simulated "addresses" of FSs are constant, even if unreachable FSs are reclaimed.  In practice, this means that various maps involving simulated heap "addresses" need to be retained and not recreated.Because they are retained, their storage needs to be released when no longer needed:  at CAS Reset time, after a services delta deserializer has completed deserializing (potentially multiple) delta CASes, or when a new non-delta serialization is started (this will re-create this storage).  For services use, we may add a new API to release this storage; the service would call it after all delta deserializations for this CAS have been received (this use case is supporting having multiple remotes working on a common CAS and having their delta results merged back into the original CAS).

texts:Missing error reports for mismatch between JCas and UIMA Type system
There is a reversed boolean test in the JCasImpl method getRequiredFeatureDE, which results in never reporting feature-not-found in UIMA type system, which initializing the JCas classes.Fixing this causes lots of test cases to start failing, due to now exposed discrepancies between the generated JCas classes and the type system used for the test cases (which is missing some of the JCas-defined features).Change the reporting mechanism to allow for reporting that doesn't throw an exception (where an exception would later be thrown if a feature was accessed which isn't in the type system, anyway).  This allows existing user code which might be sharing a JCas class with "extra" defined features which are never accessed, to report this, but run anyway (if those undefined-in-the-type-system features are never attempted to be used).

texts:uv3 change storage model to always use int and ref arrays
The first design for uv3x supported two different styles of storing data.  One style, done for cases where there was no corresponding JCas definition for a feature, was to store the feature value either in _intData or _refData arrays.  The other style was to have a field in the JCas definition for the item; for example, a string value would be stored in a locally declared String field.The JCas API would directly get/set the field in this case.  The Plain API would test for a method handle in the Feature Impl, which would be set if there was a JCas field implementation; otherwise it would inherit the general set/get code that used the storage in the _intData or _refData.The method handle approach was very efficient - Eclipse single step showed only one step to get the value, and previous testing showed this approach was even JIT - efficient.However, running the CasCopier test with and without JCas cover classes showed a large slow-down for the JCas case.  Eventually, the evidence seemed to suggest some kind of memory cache loading issue, perhaps the instruction cache, since each getter / setter (with JCas) was running a different bit of code, whereas the non-JCas was running common code.Based on this observation, change the impl to simplify things by always using the array of ints / refs approach to storing data, and change the JCas versions to reference that storage.  As part of this, code the offsets in the JCas class as static final int values computed when the class is loaded.   This imposes a restriction in the use case where, under a single class loader, multiple type systems and one set of JCas classes are being used.  Add appropriate checks to insure that the static final offset values remain correct when multiple type systems are being used.  Also add checks to insure the JCas type hierarchy is consistent with the UIMA Type system hierarchy, and that the range in the JCas getters is consistent with the UIMA type system range for each feature.

texts:JCas method like getSofaDataString that doesn&#39;t copy the chars from the StringHeap
I process large documents--the String I pass to JCas.setSofaDataString may be as large 100 MBs (50,000,000 chars).  This is causing the JVM to run out of memory when we have many concurrent AnalysisEngines running.I traced JCas.getSofaDataString(), and it eventually calls StringHeap.getStringForCode(), which does a "new String" from it's private char[] (which does a copy).This would happen for each annotator.  We have five, so now the 100 MBs has become 600 MBs.  Multiply by 10 concurrent AnalysisEngines, and that's 6,000 MBs.Perhaps there could be a variation on getSofaDataString that returns one of the other classes (besides String) that implements CharSequence.  A CharBuffer perhaps, or even a new class the implements the CharSequence interface but is read-only (just four methods).  Or even just return a char[] or char[] and begin/end offset into the StringHeap.If nothing else, perhaps the document text should be treated specially from all the little strings in the StringHeap, and be stored separately, so calls to getSofaDataString() simply return a reference to an existing String object, without copying.I'm open to possibilities, I just need the copying to end.

texts:UIMA-AS: refactor SharedConnection code in the client
Current UIMA-AS client code uses single instance of a semaphore (sharedConnectionSemaphore) to guard access to JMS connections. The client code creates a connection for each broker url a client wants to use. So there may be multiple shared connections (one per broker URL) and one semaphore for all. If one of the shared connections hangs as recently observed when using failover://(...), other threads hang waiting for a semaphore to be released. The hang is caused by silent retry in AMQ connection.start(). This method does not return if broker is not accepting a connection and client uses failover protocol.Modify client code to use different semaphore for each broker url. Failure to connect to one will not effect other connections (threads).Also, add ExceptionListener to Connection object to receive notification on failures.

texts:UIMA-AS: Fix NullPointerException
Fix NPE in the UIMA-AS service caused by a race condition when the service (remote multiplier) sends child CASes to a client. For each child it receives, the client sends a message to the service to free the CAS. Upon receipt of the message the service removes CAS from its cache.The race condition is as follows:1) Service in Thread 1 sends child CAS to client and the OS suspends the thread.2) Client immediately sends request to free CAS to the service3) Service in Thread 2 receives request to free CAS and deletes it from its cache.4) Service in Thread 1 looks up the CAS in its cache and gets NULL (since the CAS was deleted in 3) above.So the problem is that right after sending a child CAS to a client, the service tries to access cache entry for this CAS to change the state of the cache entry.Move the cache look up and state change before the send.

texts:UIMA DUCC: Agent rogue detector not working
Looks like the rogue process detector does not actually initiate process kill when it detects a rogue process. The detector does not mark a rogue process for kill immediately upon detection. It supposed to mark it for death on 3rd iteration (detection). This is done due to an asynchronous nature of the detector. It runs in a thread driven by timer. It needs to reconcile processes it finds with information sent by the OR which includes reservations. So the rogue process detector does not mark anything for death until it sees OR state.The bug in the code is in RogueProcessReaper:        if ((counter = entry.countDown()) == 0 && !entry.isKilled()) {if entry.countDown() returns a negative number the test fails and the process is not marked for death.The fix is to first check the counter to see if it is positive and only than decrement and test.

texts:XCAS operations may slow down when using command line tools
Problem description: I run documentAnalyzer tool from command line in Win to process 500KB text file by using a sample AE, create XMI output and view it in the built-in Java Viewer. The tool takes about 25 sec to open the output XMI file in the viewer. For bigger files this time may increase significantly. This happens only in those Win machines, where WebSphere products are installed.Problem analysis:The setUimaClassPath.bat script creates UIMA_CLASSPATH by adding UIMA resources to the default system CLASSPATH, which may already include 3rd party JARs (like eglbatchgen.jar in WebSphere products) containing their own implementation of org.xml.sax packages. Such JAR files may conflict with standard JDK runtime JARs and slow down XCAS related operations. If I manually modify the documentAnalyzer.bat script to use 'clear' UIMA CLASSPATH, w/o default system CLASSPATH, my XMI file opens reasonably fast (< 2 sec).Possible suggestions:a) not using default system CLASSPATH in the UIMA_CLASSPATH;b) create a tool that can identify possible CLASSPATH conflicts and form UIMA_CLASSPATH accordingly.&#8211; Lev

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Agent sets the state of process to Running
The agent wrongly sets a state of a child process to Running right after launch. This should only be done for processes which don't report their internal state transitions to the agent (JDs and APs). When a child process is launched (JP or UIMA-AS service), it immediately reports back to the agent its state as Initializing. The agent updates the child state in its internal process list and when publish inventory event is triggered the right info is communicated to the OR ( process in Initializing state).There is a race condition which produces erroneous state. In this scenario, a child process is launched, its state is set to Running, and before the process reports its state, the publish inventory is triggered and the OR is told that the process is running. Subsequent to that, the process sends a state update to its Agent telling it that its state=Initializing. The agent updates internal state of this process and publishes that state on the next publish inventory event. The problem is that the OR does not go back to Initializing once it sees a process in Running state. This is of course the right behavior.  Change the agent to set process state to Running for JDs and APs only. The other types are subject to reported state transitions with initial state=Starting.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Agent not killing a child process if it fails to stop after SIGTERM
Agent is not killing a process which fails to exit after SIGTERM is sent. When kill -15 is issued, an agent immediately sets the process state to Stopped even though the process may still be running. If a process is in Stopped state, an agent does not start a kill timer for it which leads to a process lingering on a node. The kill timer waits a configurable amount of time and when it pops, it sends SIGKILL signal to a process if its still running.  Modify code to change process state to Stopped when the process actually terminates. The agent has a handle to a process and calls its waitFor() which blocks until the process exits.

The uima-core analysisTime is cumulative and increasing each time process is called. In theory the delta should always be > 0.

texts:UIMA DUCC: Agent rogue detector not working correctly
When running with cgroups enabled, the rogue process detector should check if a process exists in any of user cgroup containers before marking such process rogue. Users may deploy an AP which can spawn child processes detached from a parent. Currently such child processes are considered rogue. The rogue detector checks the parent tree and a process which is not rooted at agent is marked as rogue.When cgroups are disabled, current code should not change as there are no containers to check. The only approach is to check parent tree.

texts:uimaj-cpe test failures on some machines when run from maven
If you cd to the uimaj-cpe directory, and do mvn install, on some machines this results in failure due to the tests using the UIMA Framework validating XML parsing, which gets the .xsd schema for resources from the class path - this produces a URL for (on Windows machines) jar:/C:/Documents and Settings/administrator/.m2/repository/   etc.  The problem is the blank space following "Documents".  The SAX parser impl stops looking right after the blank, and produces an error message about not being able to find a schema at "jar:/C:/Documents".On some machines, the URL returned from class.getResource() substitutes "%20" for blanks.  On other machines, this is not done.  I am unable to see why this works on some machines and not others.  It doesn't seem to be Java version related (two machines showing different behavior were both running java 1.6.0_01 as shown by System.getProperties("java.version")).Fix is to have the routine that gets the Resource Specifier Schema check to see if the URL has blanks in it, and if so, create another (equivalent) URL with %20 substituted for the blanks.

Although it isn't indexing, a subsequent fs_instance.addToIndexes will (if not a subtype of AnnotationBase) add the fs_instance to that last view, rather than the view the cas copier was initially specified with.

texts:Detect license text in JavaDoc
The uimaFIT maven plugin tries to pick up the documentation of a component from the JavaDoc of the implementing class. However, if there is no JavaDoc for the class, but there is a JavaDoc-like license header at the beginning of the file, then this license header is picked up again.This can be fixed by:  adding JavaDoc for the class using a  line-comment or block-comment for the license header instead of a `/**`-like JavaDoc blockAnother option (which this bug is for) is for the uimaFIT plugin to allow configuring a regular expression which is matched against the JavaDoc comment. If the regex matches, then the JavaDoc would be classified as a license (or potentially other non-documentation item) and would be ignored. E.g.                <plugin>                    <groupId>org.apache.uima</groupId>                    <artifactId>uimafit-maven-plugin</artifactId>                    <configuration>                        <ignoreJavaDocMatching>.*Licensed to.*</ignoreJavaDocMatching>                    </configuration>

When DUCC is configured to not use database (not recommended, but allowed) the Web Server (WS)  may not display Machines page data correctly in the case where the system is configured to use multiple share size quanta. Nominally, the Resource Manager (RM) places the data needed by the Web Server to properly display the Machines page into the database.  However, in the non-DB case, this is information is not shared by the RM and thus the WS must divine the needed information.  As a minimal solution that works in many cases, the WS reads the default ducc.rm.share.quantum size from ducc.properties and employ same universally.  A complete solution would be for the WS to independently do the identical calculations that the RM does with respect to multi-quanta.  Presently it does not do so, and thus this is a known limitation.

Presently, the Web Server (WS) determines up/down for the database (DB)  via JMX.  A better test would be to perform an actual DB query or perhaps even confirm that actual DB updates succeed.Likewise, a better test of broker aliveness would be to send actual messages from WS to WS via broker to insure successful round trip.Note: such changes may be problematic for "shadow" WS when not running as actual "ducc" user.

UIMA-AS 2.8.1 comes with a modified version of dd2spring.xsl which is not backwards compatible with previous versions of UIMA-AS. The problem is that bean scope=singleton is not a valid attribute in older versions of Spring framework. The documentation clearly says it is supported yet when running with older version of Spring the setting scope="singleton" causes the following exception:Caused by: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 63; columnNumber: 28; Attribute "scope" must be declared for element type "bean".Modify DUCC's root pom to change dd2spring.xsl supplied by UIMA-AS 2.8.1 by replacing offending attribute (scope="singleton") with an empty string.

I think it would be frequently convenient to have a constructor for a FS list (e.g. NonEmptyFloatList), that took one or 2 additional args.  The first additional argument would be the value to set, the 2nd optional argument would be the value for the "tail" pointer - if omitted, it would set it to the (common, shared) "empty" value for this kind of list.Also, rework getEmptyList() so it works better with existing instances of the 4 kinds of lists.

Semantic versioning fails because we introduce a new error message.  I'm not sure that qualifies, but the rules say that violates the increment-the-3rd-digit policy.Also, we'll be releasing a bug fix for binary delta cas serialization which produces an incompatible serialized form not readable by old uima versions.  This will most likely be completely hidden by an update to uima-as, but is another reason to bump the middle number.  See UIMA-4743Now, there is also a new utils class CasIOUtils with public methods/interfaces, which also violates the enforcer rule. With the help of this class, new functionality is introduced in the CAS Editor: enough reasons to make a minor release instead of a bugfix one.

texts:UV3 Pear Support
Pear support for UV3 is based on the concept of a variant of main Java Feature Structure class, indicated by a bit in the _flags.  The variant used for Pears (called trampoline), when there is a different JCas cover class for a type (due to the PEAR having a different classpath for loading these), the variant instance is constructed like a normal one except for the flag setting and for not having its own int/Object arrays for features; instead it shares those with the base feature structure instance. We use similar mechanisms as in V2 to manage this.  To locate the trampoline we use the same jcas hash map mechanism as in V2, and switch in and out various instances of those maps as pear boundaries are crossed (same as in V2).

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Agent not reporting child process GC sometimes
Looks like another race in agent process metrics gathering. This time, for some processes the garbage collection metrics are missing. An agent collects these by connecting to a remote process using jmx and querring the MBean server. Looking at the agent's log it appears that the class responsible for GC metrics gathering is initialized before the remote process sends its first status update which includes jmx connect string. If the jmx string is missing at the time of class initialization, GC metrics are not collected.

texts:UV3 refactor class loading for consistency / maintainability
There are 4 main places the UIMA framework loads classes: the Framework itself at startup, Resources, Annotators (a kind of resource) and JCas Classes.  The last 3 can make use of UIMA extension class loaders, or PEAR isolation class loaders.Refactor the code to have these where possible use common code.One issue to confirm: the current code uses 2 methods for loading classes:Class.forName and classloader.loadClass.  The Class.forName has a variant which takes 3 arguments, making it functionally equivalent to the loadClass.  But its operation is subtly different in that it caches the reference to the loaded class, even if it isn't the defining class loader, whereas loadClass doesn't do this.  See http://blog.bjhargrave.com/2007/09/classforname-caches-defined-class-in.html for a discussion of this, and the comments for a reply from Oracle tech support saying:Applications should basically never call Classloader.loadClass(). It may appear to work but it is often subtly wrong, can be a source of latent bugs, and is almost never the best choice. They should instead call Class.forName() using the 3 parameter version that takes a specific Classloader instance.Our current code always (I think) uses Class.forName for the case where there is no UIMA class loader, and loadClass otherwise.  I think this would cause failures in an OSGi loading scenario, where one of the parent loaders was an OSGi loader and it dynamically switched its "parent".  The expectation would be that the child loader (the UIMA class loader), the next time it was called to load something not in its set of classes, would delegate to the parent chain and the OSGi loader would now load from whatever was it's current "parent".  But instead, because the UIMA loader would have "cached" the class, it would instead be stuck getting the old class forever (unless the old class was eventually GC'd)  Therefore, I think to work properly in this scenario, we must always use loadClass, and never Class.forName.  The one known issue of loading named arrays doesn't arise in our case, unless from some highly usual user code, and we can catch this and use Class.forName in this instance.

When UIMA-AS service terminates due to error handling threshold being met, it logs that the service exits with exit(0), The code however forces shutdown with exit(1). Modify code to shutdown with exit(0). This should be a "normal" or expected shutdown since it is explicitly specified in error handling so 0 seems like more appropriate value.

texts:JsonCasSerializer creates duplicate shortname
Our type system includes a type named "com.intersys.uima.annotation.iknow.TOP", which inherits directly from "uima.cas.TOP" and then has a number of subtypes specific to our AE. When serializing this through the JsonCasSerializer, it generates the shortname TOP twice:{"_context":   {"_types": [    ...    "TOP": {"_id":"com.intersys.uima.annotation.iknow.TOP",                 "_subtypes":["Entity","ProximityScore"]},    "TOP": {"_id":"uima.cas.TOP",                 "_subtypes":["TOP","AnnotationBase","ArrayBase","Sofa"]},    ...]  }}While we can work around this by renaming our top type, the documentation explicitly states this shouldn't pose a problem and shortnames would be de-duplicated automatically:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.8.1/references.html#ugr.ref.json.overview Section 9.2.2:In the _types section, the key (e.g. "Sofa" or "A_Typical_User_or_built_in_Type") is the "short" name for the type used in the serialization. It is either just the last segment of the full type name (e.g. for the type x.y.z.TypeName, it's TypeName), or, if name would collide with another type name if just the last segment was used (example: some.package.cname.Foo, and some.other.package.cname.Foo), then the key is made up of the next-to-last segment, with an optional suffixed incrementing integer in case of collisions on that name, a colon ( and then the last name.I see there are unit test checking for this, but maybe it's because uima.cas.TOP is sort of a special case? Or because neither uima.cas.TOP nor our custom TOP is actually used directly (only subtypes are). So before I go ahead and change our root type name, I'd like to make sure this isn't something the framework should have taken care of itself.

Currently the complete Settings object that holds all the external override settings loaded by the framework is accessible via UimaContextAdmin.An improvement would be to allow individual values to be read using a method in the UimaContext interface, perhaps: String getExternalOverride(String name)String[] getExternalOverrideArray{String name)

CasUtil.indexCovered() currently uses a quite naive approach of going over all of the covering candidate annotations and calling selectCovered for each of them. This can be done smarter by iterating simultaneously over the covering and covered type while maintaining a memory in which only the potentially covering annotations are maintained and compared against the covered annotations. Any annotation of the covering type can be purged from this memory once it cannot match any covering annotation anymore. This approach exploits the sort order inherent in the annotation index.

texts:JCas not always initialized
JCas classes are loaded lazily on the first switch of the CAS to the JCas format.JCas support includes support for nested JCas class loading contexts, which can be established either by setting the UIMA Extension class loader when a pipeline is instantiated, and/or by entering a Pear (which establishes its own classpath for use within the Pear).If the first switch to JCas format occurs within an inner class loading context, when the outer class loading context is in force, the switch to JCas no longer triggers the lazy loading of the JCas classes for that class loading context (because JCas was already loaded).  This bug causes the outer class loading context to not be initialized for JCas.  See UIMA-5054 for an example where this occurred.Fix this to remember JCas initialization per class loader, or by locating all the outer classloading contexts at the time the JCas is turned on, and re-initializing these with the JCas versions of the generators (this is a non-lazy approach and may do extra work, for example, if the outer context isn't using JCas).

texts:UIMA Class loader switching design needs to support more than 2 levels
A recent Jira UIMA-5054 highlighted a potential use case not previously adequately considered: classloader - application - loads the "main" (under CL#1) main instantiates a UIMA pipeline, specifying an extension class loader (CL#2) UIMA pipeline contains a Pear, specifying its own class loader (CL#3).JCas class may be used by code loaded under any of these 3 class loaders.  In the example in UIMA-5054, a component called by the UIMA Framework was loaded under CL#1, so the framework needed to "switch" to this.  Had that component been inside a Pear, it would need to switch to CL#1 from CL#3, and then restore CL#3 when returning from the component back to the UIMA Framework.  But the current design for switching only supports 2 (not 3 or more) levels of switching / restoring.Extend this to support arbitrary levels, using some kind of a stack mechanism.  Two things need extension: support for tracking the current JCas class loader, and support that tracks the current JCasHashMap instance. After some more investigation and thought, this may not be necessary in normal cases.  This is because the initial CAS JCasLoader value is set to the loader specified when the pipeline is set up, and then only switches when calling Pears, or when calling user code in exit callbacks.  The issue came up previously because one of the exit callbacks was into code loaded by CL#1.  Even in that case, only one level of remembering (to restore the previous class loader) is needed.Other cases (somewhat convoluted) may still require a stack implementation.  One is nested Pears (not currently supported). Anyone know of other cases?  If not, I'll probably defer this for now.

texts:Scaled out pipelines can falsely trigger the error: Illegal adding of additional MetaData after CASes have been defined
When UIMA-AS scales out a synchronous UIMA pipeline it sequentially creates separate AEs in separate threads, sharing the resource manager.  Creation of the 2nd (identical) AE will fail with "Illegal adding of additional MetaData after CASes have been defined" if a descriptor imports 2 type-system files, one of which is included in the other.  The check fails to recognize that the types loaded by the 2nd AE are already in the resource manager because of the way type-systems are cached.

texts:UIMA DUCC: http dispatch code doesn&#39;t rethrow exception
The BaseHttpDispatcher.dispatchAndWaitForDuccReply() "swallows" exceptions in try .. catch(). On exception it dumps the trace using e.printStackTrace() never re-throwing it up to the caller and instead returning null. Modify to rethrow an exception and also modify all code that uses the method in question. This method is used by the CLI apparently. Modify every instance of code that calls the API and add try .. catch to handle an exception in a specific way. It looks like the method returning null is an error condition the client code considers as an error. Seems like a bad practice to me to use null as an error condition if it is caused by an exception in a generic code which dispatchAndWaitForDuccReply() in fact is. This code is also called from the PM and perhaps other places and null as a return value obfuscates the  real cause. Each client should handle an exception as appropriate.

uimaFIT tests re-use a single CAS which is stored in a thread-local variable and reset that CAS between unit tests. Apparently there was some change which causes the Sofa-mapping information - or more specifically the current component info from which that mapping is obtained - to not be reset anymore. The problem only appears when running all uimafit-core tests jointly in one JVM, e.g. from Eclipse.Initial hypothesis which proved to be wrong: There may be a bug that might be related to the UimaContextHolder not being cleaned up probably (probably in case of some kind of failure).The problem appears when running the uimafit-core tests in Eclipse. Here all tests run in the same JVM instance which allows "global" information like thread locals to be carried over between unit tests.Then running all tests and when the `ViewCreatorAnnotatorTest` runs before the `SimplePipelineTest`, then the deserialization of an XMI file fails because `_InitialView` is still mapped to `myView` in the UIMA context. Debugging yields that the UIMAContext in use for the SimplePipelineTest apparently still belongs to the `ViewCreatorAnnotatorTest` because the mQualifiedContextName is `/org.apache.uima.fit.component.ViewCreatorAnnotatorTest$SofaAwareAnnotator/`This hypothesis was wrong: checked it by verifying that UimaContextHolder.getContext() is null before and after each unit test.

From version 1.x to 2.x we broke XCAS compatibility.  (v2.x can read v1.x XCASes but not vice-versa.)  We've been thinking we might want to have a version number on the XCAS so that we can detect an incompatibility and report a good error message.It occurs to me that what changed here is not the XCAS syntax, but the built-in CAS type system.  In v2.x the annotation type changed (the "sofa" feature became a reference instead of an int).  Also new primitive types and new array types were added.So perhaps the right thing to do is to have a version number on the CAS built-in type system, and dump that version number in our XCAS (and XMI) serializations.I'm not sure if it's right to just use the framework version number (which might lock us into a versioning scheme such as agreeing not to add new built-in types without incrementing the major version number), or having a completely separate version number just for the built-in type system?

texts:auto set missing AnnotationBase sofaRef feature
This Jira describes a possible approach to automatically recovering from an error condition, which might be implemented.Sometimes, the sofa feature of a FS which is a subtype of AnnotationBase is missing (is null) when the FS is being added to the indexes of some particular CAS View.  One way this can happen is during (lenient) deserialization of XMI or XCAS CASes, after some update has occurred to the type system, which changes a type from not being a subtype of AnnotationBase, to having that as a supertype.In this case (where the sofa reference is null), instead of throwing an exception, set the sofa reference to the likely proper value - the sofa that corresponds to the view it is being indexed in.  If there is no sofa for that view (unlikely but possible), throw an exception.If this recovery is done, output a diminishing frequency log message about it.

texts:DUCC Job Driver (JD) erroneously logs ***** TIMEOUT *****
In the JD log we see:14 Sep 2016 10:41:29,157 ERROR JD.err - T&#91;34&#93; record  seqNo=2 ***** TIMEOUT *****[B@e9a57948But this log entry is not correct.  The real problem is that the JD tried to convert the Exception object that occurred in "user space" into a string, but that fails and the JD then makes the wrong assumption that a timeout must have occurred because it finds value of null for the stringified Exception...wrong!

texts:UIMA-AS: Cas Multiplier service doesnt recover from broker restart
After broker restart the top level UIMA-AS service Cas Multiplier does not recover completely. The jms listener on an input queue recovers fine, but a listener on a temp queue processing FreeCas requests does not. The temp queue is created on a service startup. When a broker is bounced, this temp queue is no longer valid as it was created using an old broker connection. The listener on this temp queue just keeps logging rapidly filling a log. All outgoing child CASes contain a stale replyTo queue and such CASes are never freed by the service leading to an empty Cas Pool eventually.There is no auto recovery of temp queues. A listener on a temp queue must be shutdown and instantiated again. When a lost connection is detected, the service must:1) invalidate its listener on a temp queue (FreeCas queue)2) all unacknowledged child CASes that have been dispatched to a client must be automatically released.3) a new temp queue should be created along with a listener for it.When UIMA-AS client is unable to send FreeCas requests to a service due to a stale queue, it should log a message with a CAS Id and complete processing the CAS.

texts:UIMA CasIOUtils enhancements in handling type systems
A recent Jira UIMA-5120 was logging CASs to file system directories, and including a type system.  It would be good to have a conventional,supported way to do this common kind of operation, added to CasIOUtils.Additionally, it would be good to support as an alternative the standard XML serialization format for type systems.Some possible conventions:   multiple cas files, in 1 directory, with one additional file with the name "typesystem.xml". the above style, in one zip file (for example, to be able to read it, one cas at a time, via some iterator). finding a type system via the class path following uimaFIT conventionsOne factor that probably is important is to store the type system for this kind of thing "close to" the serialized forms it applies to.It would be possible of course to support multiple conventions.  However, the more conventions, the less benefit from "standardization", so this ought to be a balance.

UIMA-2903 mentioned that External Resources, created by a Resource Manager, get instantiated with a different, unconnected, unique Resource Manager instance (returned by that Resource's getResourceManager() API), and suggests that it would be a better design to have the External Resource's getResourceManager() API return the ResourceManager that created it, instead.This seems very reasonable to me.  This Jira will change the implementation to do this.It's possible that this may break code which was depending on having External Resource Creation being set up with an independent ResourceManager instance, but I doubt any code is depending on this.

texts:CDE tool has unneeded dependency on PDE UI - making it not resolve in last Eclipse download packaging unless you download the "Classic"
With Eclipse 3.3, the packaging of Eclipse changed.  Users now will likely download a version of Eclipse which doesn't include the PDE development environment because this is the first (top) choice in the menu picks for Eclipse downloads.  If the user downloads the bottom menu pick (Eclipse "Classic") everything will work.  The CDE appears to have an unused / unneeded dependency on a plugin in the PDE development environment.  Fix is to remove this dependency and retest.

texts:uv3 change id to match v2
v3's current ids start at 1 and increment by 1.  v2 ids start at 1 and increment by the "size" on the main int heap of the FS. Pros: v3's serializations / deserializations often need to recreate the v2 ids so the serialized forms can be read by v2 impl (for backwards compatibility), so this can have a performance benefit. It also improves the match for xmi/json id-refs with version 2 (although xmi deserialization should still work without this).  Cons: Changing to the v2 style will reduce the maximum number of Feature Structures per CAS somewhat; it will be the same as the current limit that exists in v2.Because of pros/cons, keep both impls, together with a global static final boolean switch to pick one or the other (and set it for now to use the v2 style).

texts:uv3 support for arbitrary Java objects in the CAS
Using JCas, it has been possible to have arbitrary Java objects included in the Java instance.  The problem with doing this has been that there was no architected way for these objects to participate in the broader UIMA interoperability concepts such as serialization, remote annotators, etc.  And, furthermore, JCas objects were optional, and might not be used.UIMA V3 implements Feature Structures in the CAS as JCas objects directly, so these are now always present and reliable.  This means that when an implementation adds arbitrary Java objects (e.g, a special HashSet containing Feature Structures) to a JCas class definition, they are reliably present.Here's how we could make this all work in v3.A user would first pick some Java class to emulate in the CAS.  A requirement would be that the data in the emulated class would need to support having a serialized form representing a  "snapshot" of the data at a particular moment, that  could be put into the CAS using a fixed number of UIMA features of normal UIMA data types, including Feature Structures.  For example, an ArrayList<FeatureStructure>  could be put into the CAS as an FSArray instance of the current size; a Map<Integer, FeatureStructure> could be put into the CAS as an IntegerArray and an FSArray, etc.  The snapshot would be produced whenever needed, for example, during serialization.  A corresponding transformation (used, for instance, during deserialization) would convert the snapshot data back into the emulated Java class instance.This new kind of hybrid object would be implemented with a custom JCas cover class which wrapped the emulated Java class instance.  It would also have as features those needed for the "snapshot" representation.The user would need to  define a UIMA type; this type would include the feature definitions needed for the snapshot. create the corresponding JCas cover class for that type add 3 extra methods in the cover class, all methods defined by a new UIMA interface "UimaSerializable"   _init_from_cas_data()  _save_to_cas_data()  clone  The _init_from_cas_data would use the cas data in this Feature Structure to initialize the emulated Java class.  This method would be called by the framework whenever it makes a new instance with non-empty Feature Structure data (for example, during deserialization), so that the emulated Java class instance may be initialized.  This would typically be called by routines like the cas copier and deserialization.Similarly, the _save_to_cas_data would be called by the framework as part of serialization, and would extract data from the emulated Java class and save as CAS features..This Jira adds support for this approach; other Jiras will add some likely popular new types (example: FSArrayList - like ArrayList<TOP>).  Users can (easily ?) add types of their own, for instance, if they need a peculiar kind of Set of Feature Structures, perhaps built on top of ConcurrentSkipListSet using a special definition of set-member-equals.

texts:uv3 vs backporting most things to uv2?
The uv3 docs - overview has a summary of the "features" / benefits of uv3.  I was surprised to realize, looking at these, that most of these could be back-ported into version 2.  Because of this, there is a choice in moving forwards, either to stick to the current v2 data representation models (sticking), or switch to new v3 ones (for Java).  In the subsequent discussion, "sticking" refers to a currently non-existent v2 where the v3 improvements (except for changing how Feature Structures are stored) are backported.The two benefits lost in sticking are:  garbage collection of unreferenced Feature Structures. larger limits on the number of Feature Structures per CAS (approximately order of magnitude).  This is due to the fact that in v2, all of the slots for all Feature Structures and int and float arrays are kept in one int array, which has a limit of approximately 2 billion words.Benefits in sticking include: (perhaps) better backwards compatibility a smaller memory footprint if JCas is not being used (imagine UIMA running on a smartphone) (maybe) better performance in some cases, including serializationRegarding performance differences:  v3 may be more performant in many cases because of not needing to switch from low-level int handles to JCas object references.  But it may be less performant in some operations involving serialization, because of the overhead to emulate/model the way v2 does serialization.  New Native-to-v3 serializaton forms that are not backward compatible could be added to v3 to overcome this.   The things that could be backported to v2 include: redesigning the JCas cover classes for higher performance (eliminating the xxx_Type classes, putting an extra field in the xxx cover class instead).   note: a JCas class migration would be needed for this, similar to the one for v3.   redesigning much of the supporting infrastructure to improve performance by increasing locality of reference. supporting arbitrary Java Objects, and backporting the implementation of FSArrayList and IntegerArrayList integrating with Java 8 - including the new select framework eliminating problems with ConcurrentModificationException while iterating over UIMA indexes reusing Type SystemsComparing v3 versus v2+backport, what do people think of the balance between pro/con?  Should we focus on a v2+backport direction instead of v3?

texts:JSON serialization in uima core wrong context, sometimes
Running json test in v3 revealed two bugs in the JSON serialization.1) reset the cache in "sortedUsedTypes" when starting serailization because this may have changed (in CasSerializerSupport)2) Also in CasSerializerSupport - make the static Comparator used for sorting types used, public, so it can be used by the JSON serializer code when doing a binary search to see if a type is present.3) Change the code in JsonCasSerializer which does the binary search to use this same comparator, because the search must use the same sort ordering.

The annotation viewer has the possibility to use the browser to show the annotation results. By default on Linux the "mozilla" browser is used.On "old" Linux systems, "mozilla" is correct to call, but I think on newer Linux systems, "mozilla" never works...http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2006/101106-portland-project.html describesxdg-utils, and says Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Debian have already committed to installing the utilities.One utility enables visiting a Web page in the user's chosen browser.On Debian, this capability is available via the command "x-www-browser", which launches the user's graphical browser of choice.OSDL's xdg-utils extends the availability across distributions.See http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/ for details on xdg-utils.

Performance metrics list returned to the client does not preserve consistent order in deployments using concurrent process threads. For example if there are two pipelines  containing AE1, AE2, AE3, the service sends metrics list as: AE2, AE1, AE3 for CAS1  and for CAS2 it returns AE3, AE1, AE2. The order of AEs in the list should be consistent across all CASes.

texts:uv3 throw new exception v2 binary delta deserialization
Version 3 models the v2 layout by scanning all reachable FSs; this drops (versus v2) unreachable FSs.  Binary form deltas encode the changes relative to this model. Because the model for v3 doesn't match v2's (due to the omission of unreachable FSs), delta updates can't be handled when reading a v2-generated delta cas into a v3 instance.  Throw an exception for this case (using binary deserializing of Delta CASs generated using V2 into a V3 instance).  Document this in the backwards compatibility section.

There seems to be an infinite loop within the AnnotationIndexImpl addChildren() method, called by the tree() method.  The subiterator that is passed in doesn't seem to be pushed to the next value, and so it just sits and loops forever.  I changed the loop to the code below and it seems to solve the problem.while (it.hasNext()) {    annot = (AnnotationFS) it.next();    dtr = new AnnotationTreeNodeImpl();    dtr.set(annot);    node.addChild(dtr);    addChildren(dtr, subiterator(annot));}

texts:DUCC failover support (static)
DUCC should provide the capability to move the head node, comprising the broker, database, Orchestrator, PM, RM, SM, and WS, and have the agents seamlessly switch over w/o service disruption.&#8212;In this "static" failover implementation the agents are pre-configured with a list of potential head nodes.  Introduced into the ducc.properties file is the key ducc.head.failover whose value is a comma separated list of failover nodes:ducc.head.failover = node1, node2, node3...The agents at boot time are configured for broker failover to this set of nodes.If ducc.head.failover is not specified, then the failover functionality is simply not supported for the installation (e.g. no seamless transition of running agents to an alternate broker head node).If ducc.head.failover is specified, then the node specified for ducc.head must appear in this list.

texts:uv3 delta serializing- handle case where delta is for non-reachable FS
In version 3 FSs may be unreachable (if not indexed, and if no other FS that is reachable references them).  Serialization only serializes the reachable FSs; it can't find the others. It's possible that some modifications are done to FSs which subsequently are unreachable.  When serializing, these modifications can't be found in the set of known FSs being serialized.  Handle this case by skipping serialization of those modifications.

texts:XMI Serialization fails for parameterized arrays
When a parameterized array (an array with an elementType) is serialized to XMI, the elements of the array are not correctly added to the queue of FSs to be serialized.  That means that if these FSs are not otherwise indexed or referenceable, they will be omitted from the output.

texts:uv3 backwards compatibility - add nonJCas built-in cover classes back
UIMA v2 implemented for built-ins, 2 kinds of Java cover classes.  One was "JCas" the other not.  Users not using the JCas could make use of the other style.  V3 has only one style, and uses JCas versions for the actual Feature Structure Implementation.  Create interfaces for the non-JCas style, and supply them with default methods that cast "this" to the JCas style actually being used.Arrange the hierarchy to follow v2 where possible. Take out new v3 upper hierarchy common classes where a v2 class already exists; use that class instead (with appropriate casting as above) - so that V2 code that uses these continues to work. Update the docs: remove the part which says users have to rename the non-JCas class uses to the JCas ones (will no longer be required).

texts:uv3 copy-on-write needs reset for moveToFirst/Last/fs
In v2, iterators may throw ConcurrentModificationException when an index is updated while it's being iterated over. In v3, this is avoided by doing the minimal copy-on-write operation to the affected portion of the indexes. There is an exception in v2 to this: 3 operations "reset" the modification tracking state to the current state of the index.  These operations are those that move the interator to a known position.  There are three API calls that do this: moveToFirst, moveToLast, and moveTo (meaning move to a position indicated by the passed-in FeatureStructure). The corresponding operation for v3 has to be: for these three operations, if a copy-on-write operation has occurred, to reset the iterator to a fresh view of the current state of the underlying index (discarding the copy-on write version).

The failing one has a machine qualifier: "aarch64" which is for an "ARM" machine.  So the build probably needs to be directed to not build for that architecture?Build was on "ubuntu" machine, which is unlikely to be an "arm" - so probably something is wrong with the maven upload that happened on Jan 7.  Investigating.There are multiple artifacts missing in maven central from the Jan 7 update.  The fix seems to be to exclude somewhat high up in the chain of dependencies.  Added 4 exclude points determined by trial and error to ep-debug and ep-launcher, the other projects don't seem to have an issue.  Now builds.

These are the minor changes I made to ruta-core to accomodate UIMA v3; I believe they are compatible with V2.in Ruta.java the 2nd "inject" method, change the 2nd arg from Annotation ... to FeatureStructureImpl ... remove the 3rd "inject" method - now covered by 2nd. change getAddresses arg list to have type FeatureStructureImpl[] remove the 2nd getAddresses method (now covered by previous one).These (above) changes accomodate the fact that there's just one impl of Annotation in v3, and AnnotationImpl is now an interface.============In RutaEngine, the process method sets a variable:boolean typeSystemChanged = lastTypeSystem != cas.getTypeSystem();In UIMA V3, loading a new type system which is identical to a previously committed type system, results in the cas.getTypeSystem being == to the "lastTypeSystem".  So as a result, you can't use this to determine if a new type system was loaded.  The line 484 fails for one test because of this.  The workaround is to set "typeSystemChanged" to true, always.  But you might have a better solution.

These changes were needed to make the tests run in uimaFIT.  I think all of these are backward OK with V2.CasDumpWriterTestThe "toString" for FeatureStructures writes the id as well, so that needs to be stripped.  e.g. FS "Foo" is printed as "Foo:17".After line 55, insert:    // uima v3 writes "Uima-type-name:nnnnn" delete the :nnnnn to make it the same as v2    actual = actual.replaceAll("(\\w*)\\:d{1,}(s)", "$1$2");This same fix needs to be applied multiple places.  here are the others: JCasBuilderTest, after line 69 CasDumpWriterTest (in uimafit-legacy-support) JCasBuilderTest (in uimafit-legacy-support)=================in FSUtilTest: there's a compare test for the two styles of Annotation class in V2:  "Annotation" and "AnnotationImpl".  In V3, there's only one style so this variation testing could be skipped.  Better yet, it can be written so it works in V2 and V3, by changing the compare of the feature value's class-name to a constant, to testing that the feature value is an "instanceof" AnnotationImpl (in the 2nd test).  The first test, seeing if the feature value's classname is "org.apache.uima.jcas.tcas.Annotation" is still valid.This test happens in two places in FSUtilTest, both need updating.

The built eclipse update site is missing the uimaj-ep-jcasgen plugin.  The build correctly built it, the publishing steps failed at the very end.  Finally traced to an issue with the version level of the maven-bundle-plugin. This was noticed before when UIMA-5202 was worked on, because another plugin (the uimaj-ep-configurator) also got dropped, when, as part of 5202, the maven-bundle-plugin was upgraded to 3.0.1.  This was done to fix errors that occurred when the bundle plugin was scanning Java 8 classes and looking up things related to that.  Fix this by restoring the default back to 2.3.7, and just overriding this to 3.0.1 for the one plugin needing it, the uimaj-ep-runtime plugin and the one plugin not building in Eclipse env: uimaj-ep-launcher.

This seems to fall apart somewhat, when working with 1.2.3-alpha-SNAPSHOT - the coverter changes just the first hyphen it finds (left to right scan) to a period, giving for this example 1.2.3.alpha-SNAPSHOT.  There are other problems with this, see https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN400.To avoid these issues, I'm renaming 3.0.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.  The readme and announcement will say alpha.

texts:Support descriptor customization by allowing external setting variables in some fields
Currently the <envVarRef> element supports customization via system properties in 4 ways (see below).  UIMA could also support the ${variable-name} syntax in these text fields.  In addition it could also be supported in the value for the name and location attributes of the import element so that an aggregate's delegates could be controlled via external settings.  This might also be done by changing the primitive descriptor as in 2 & 3 below, but in some cases a completely different delegate descriptor is preferable.From the References document:The syntax for environment variable references is <envVarRef>&#91;VariableName&#93;</envVarRef> , where &#91;VariableName&#93; is any valid Java system property name. Environment variable references are valid in the following places:1)   The value of a configuration parameter (String-valued parameters only)2)  The <annotatorImplementationName> element of a primitive AE descriptor3)   The <name> element within <analysisEngineMetaData>4)   Within a <fileResourceSpecifier> or <fileLanguageResourceSpecifier>

texts:selectPreceding fails to skip over annotations
The annotation index is sorted by begin (ascending) and end (descending). That effect is taken into account in selectFollowing and selectBetween to ensure that only annotations that begin after a certain offset or that lie entirely between two given offsets are returned.The present implementation of selectPreceding seeks backwards from the reference annotation until it finds the first annotation that ends before the start of the reference annotation. However, then it fails to recognize that the end offsets of annotations are not monotonically decreasing because the end-offset is only the secondary sorting criterium (the primary criterium is the begin-offset). This appears to be a bug in the present implementation.This issue exists since when selectPreceding was first introduced in version 1.1.0 (pre-Apache). Hence it is difficult to tell if anybody has come to rely on it.

texts:uv3 logging: change defaults, add suppress logging from annotators capability
per discussion on dev list:1) Make UIMA more embeddable by having it able to not have its own back-end for logging.  2) Never-the-less, have the out-of-the-box experience do reasonable logging.3) Provide a simple, not logging-back-end-specific, way to globally suppress logging from Annotator code.

While comparing output of v2 and v3 test suites, I found differences due to different ordering of tests, and the fact that tests would set a level on a log, and not reset it back afterwards, or they would set a mode of XML parse schema validation and not set it back afterwards.  Use try / finally or setup/teardown to reset things like this in test cases.  Probably not worth fixing in v2, so not queued up for that.

Eventually discovered after a day of poking around, and improving a diagnostic in core uima for UIMAFramework where it was trying to load the factory configuration, and getting an exception during class initialization (the improvement: print the exception), found out that the full build ended up having slf4j "simple logger" in the class path that was being used, and slf4j was hooking this up as its back-end.  But this logger doesn't implement the location-aware interface, so a cast to that was failing.  Fix this to no longer require this.

In the class org.apache.uima.resource.metadata.impl.MetaDataObject_impl, the equals() method returns immediately with the comparison result of the first Map elements, leaving the rest of the Map's element uncompared. Here is the code snippet:         while (it.hasNext()) {          Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) it.next();          Object subval1 = ((Map) val1).get(entry.getKey());          Object subval2 = ((Map) val2).get(entry.getKey());          if (subval1 == null) {            if (subval2 != null)              return false;          } else if (subval1 instanceof Object[]) {            if (!(subval2 instanceof Object[]))              return false;            if (!Arrays.equals((Object[]) subval1, (Object[]) subval2))              return false;line:443  } elseline:444      return subval1.equals(subval2);        }The problem with the code is that the statement line 444 will return the result immediately, causing the while loop to be quit without comparing the rest of elements in the Map.To fix this, one could replace line 443 and 444 with the following:           } else if (!(subval1.equals(subval2)) {                  return false;           }

Implement a new embeddable driver component which will deliver Work Items to services that use GET/ACK/END protocol. This protocol is currently used between a JP and JD. Its a pull based, synchronous request/response exchange with a JP being a requestor. The new Driver will enable an application to plug in a callback listener which will implement the following interface:public interface TaskAllocatorCallbackListener  { public String getSerializedCAS(TaskConsumer taskConsumer);        public void onTaskSuccess(TaskConsumer taskConsumer, IPerformanceMetrics metrics);        public void onTaskFailure(TaskConsumer taskConsumer, String stringifiedException);}The Driver will call getSerializedCAS() when it receives a GET request from a remote service, The method must return a serializedCAS or null if there are none available. The TaskConsumer argument identifies where the CAS will be processed [ host, pid, thread id, service type ]. The Driver will call onTaskSuccess() when it receives END from a remote service and processing of a CAS succeeded. In addition to TaskConsumer argument, the IPerformanceMetrics instance will be passed in which will contains performance breakdown.The Driver will call onTaskFailure() when it receives END from a remote service and processing of a CAS failed. In addition to TaskConsumer argument, a serialized exception (String) will be passed in to identify the cause of failure.The Driver assumes that the TaskAllocatorCallbackListener implementation will catch and handle its errors and none will be rethrown.

UIMA Logger levels are modeled on java.util.logging.Level.  This has levels: SEVERE/WARNING/INFO/CONFIG/FINE/FINER/FINEST.  Newer loggers, including the common facade SLF4J have levels ERROR/WARN/INFO/TRACE/DEBUG.  Because UIMA v3 is using the slf4j style as a default, it needs to have a mapping between these levels.  The initial mapping needs updating slightly so that it is compatible with the already in existence mappings done by uimaFIT in its Extended Logger implementation. Change the mappings to:SEVERE  <-> ERRORWARNING <-> WARNINFO    <-> INFOCONFIG  <-> INFO   (distinguished by a marker, UIMA_MARKER_CONFIG)*FINE    <-> DEBUG  *FINER   <-> TRACE  *FINEST  <-> TRACE (distinguished by a marker, UIMA_MARKER_FINEST) The asterisks mark the changes.

Some dependencies in the uimaj project are scope compile, which would be better as scope provided, to allow downstream projects that depend on this to *not* have these dependencies added to their project.Examples: the jar that is used only at compile time to supply annotations for Findbugs; the jars that are used at compile time for the log4j logging impl (the downstream depender may not be using log4j, and having these causes maybe wrong slf4j selection of the logging back end).When moving log4j things to provided, this also removes them from the test classpath, which makes the tests that need log4j break.  Fix this by configuring the surefire plugin to add these dependencies back just for testing (a hack, but I don't know of a better way).

This matches the hashcode for that.Change the sortCompare function to only return 0 if the id's are the same.

texts:uv3 logger test dependencies incorrect or missing
Some test cases need the logger.  The uv3 default logger is no logger - and slf4j uses its "NOP" logger.  To make these tests work like they do in v2, add a test dependency on the slf4j-jdk14 adapter.  One project had this accidentally added but not as a test scope (it used the default compile scope).  This worked, except it showed up a (probable) bug in Maven / Invoker, when running the jcasgen-maven-plugin integration tests - the slfj4-api would go missing from the jcasgen maven plugin's environment.  Fixing the other dependency in uimaj-cpe for slfj4-jdk14 to "test" made the invoker plugin no longer delete the slf4j-api jar from its execution classpath.  (Documented here for historical reasons, and because it took most of a day to debug this!)

When I reverted backto 2.3.7, for those, it worked.  So this might take more investigation to get tothe underlying root causes.4) I had to fix an (already reported) problem in ruta-ep-example-extensionswhere the type system for NBSP's super type was incorrect.

In this case, arrange for the UIMA logger to get the alternate JUL (java.util.logging) logger, instead of the slf4j (which will remain hooked up to the NOP back end logger).Update the scripts that run tools (the runUimaClass.bat and .sh) to define this JVM property when starting UIMA tooling, so that tools started using the default scripts will have some logging, if no back end is specified.

texts:uv3 migration tool class path setup
There are multiple issues with the migrateClasspath setup for v3 migration.  There are two uses of the classpath.   One is for decompiling the v2 compiled classes, when migrating from classes - roots. The other is for (optional) compiling of the resulting converted source.  These is done for the use case where the v2 classes were in JARs or PEARs, and the result of the conversion is new versions of these JARs or PEARs with converted JCas classes.The classpath passed for migrateClasspath should be the v2 classpath needed for decompiling the v2 JCas classes. When recompiling, the classpath for v3 uimaj-core is prepended.migrateClasspath is temporarily augmented when migrating PEAR files, by prepending any PEAR classpath specs.A separate Jira improved the migrateClasspath to permit the Java style of classpath specs using a trailing wildcard .Changes needed: if the migrateClasspath argument is not set:   if migrating from classes roots, treat this as an error; migrateClasspath is required in order to properly decompile.     Add a note that this classpath must include the classes being migrated, because they are read from that classpath.      If migrating from sources roots, if the migrateClasspath is not set, substitute the application classpath, with a warning.   for compiling:   do the PEAR prepending if the source came from a pear.  prepend at the very front, the uimaj-core-v3 (or the app classpath).

texts:UIMA-AS: add support for targeting specific service instance via JMS
With multiple service instances getting messages from a shared JMS queue there is no way to know which instance gets a particular message. By design, the JMS queue provides natural load balancing and a broker routes a message to a service which has capacity (ready thread) to process it.Targeting services would support interesting use cases. For example, sending a message to a specific service instance could be used to determine if the service is viable or not. Targeted messages can also be considered of high processing priority and processed ahead of 'normal' priority messages. JMS supports targeting with selectors. A message listener is configured to indicate which messages it wants to receive. The selection is based on a value of a JMS property included in a message. The JMS selector syntax is based on SQL 92 spec which allows for compound expressions that include: AND, OR, NOT, etc. The message selection is done by the broker not the consumer. The broker will route messages to a consumer whose selector matches property values in a message.Current UIMA-AS already supports two selectors, one for handling Process requests and the other for GetMeta. Each of these has a dedicated listener and thread(s) to process messages. The proposal is to add yet another listener with a new selector to support targeting. The service selector value can be user defined via -DHighPriorityServiceId=XXX. If the -D is not present, the UIMA-AS will create a new listener with a selector = &#91;Node IP: PID&#93; which would uniquely identify a service. It would be up to the client application to determine value for the targeting string (selector). The UIMA-AS client will provide a way for an application to specify targeting string via a Map which is passed into the initialize( ) method of the UIMA-AS client. This would allow for pinning a client to a specific service instance. All messages from the client would be processed by that service. If targeting string is not present, targeting will not be enabled and messages will be processed by an arbitrary service instance.As mentioned, targeted messages will have a high priority and will be processed first. A new java priority queue will be added to the UIMA-AS service to enable sorting of messages according to the priority.

texts:UIMA-AS: sendAndReceive() should throw Exception when client is in shutdown mode
When  an application calls UIMA-AS client sendAndReceive() its thread will block until a reply comes back or stop() is called. While a thread blocks in sendAndReceive() a System.exit() may be called causing the UIMA-AS client ShutdownHook to call stop(). This method will cleanup resources including a semaphore where an application thread blocks in sendAndReceive. In this case, the sendAndReceive() simply returns realizing that the client is not in a running state. The application is not aware that the sendAndReceive() was essentially interrupted as a reply had not been received. The application may consider the CAS as processed as there was no exception,The sendAndReceive() should throw an exception if UIMA-AS client stop() was called while an application thread blocked awaiting reply from a service. Throw ResourceProcessException with cause = UimaAsClientStoppingException. This will let the application know about the cause of the interrupt.

The design for the migration tool has some defects.  The main one is it should migrate all versions  the migrate from sources vs from classes should operate differently:   sources     migrate the source, no subsequent compilation; no reassembly (in Jars or PEARs)   if in a Jar or PEAR, issue message saying Jar or PEAR will need to be rebuilt and advising to delete the xxx_Type.java files.      classes     decompile.  Always use the original byte array for decompiling (current impl switches to the version from the classpath). Arrange the migrate classpath to put any Jar or Pear-classpath in front.   do a compile using above modified migrate classpath (plus the uv3 core in front) and reassembly step (if class was found in Jars or Pears, an no compile errors) by copying the original assembly and updating the class part.       change the output naming convention to support multiple compiled migrations - for example, having the same class inside multiple updated Jars, with obvious tracking between the output pathnames and the original. update the version of the parser and decompiler dependencies to the current versions update the documentation. properly handle jars containing pears, pears containing jars. allow no migrate classpath when migrating from classes (useful for migrating Pear files) break the compile step for a container into multiple sets of compilation units, if different versions exist for the same classname (otherwise get compiler error - duplicate definition) print out all compiler errors and messages

texts:UIMA Class Loader getResource doesn&#39;t look first in its own resources
The UIMAClassLoader stategy is to load from this class loader before delegating to its parent.  It does this for classes, but missed doing this for "resources" obtained by getResource.  I think this should be fixed so that a Pear, trying to load its resource, will get that resource, and not a same-named one from some parent classloader. This might break some existing use cases, as it changes where some resources will come from.

UIMA defines iterators over an Index as "undefined" for FSs which compare equal using the Index's comparator.  For example, for Annotations, this is based on the begin and end features, and the type via the type priority ordering (if one exists).UIMA v2 and v3 treat these undefined elements differently, and have different iteration orders.  For users who may have inadvertantly written code that depends on iteration order for "equal" FSs, the results may differ.  Document this as part of the backward compatibility differences.

Other threads (if scaleout > 1), should block doing nothing until a thread doing the retry succeeds.

texts:Set Index implicit use of type in comparator - document and add test case
UIMA Set indexes are implemented such that the type is an implicit part of the key set used for determining equality.  In other words, two Feature Structures of different types, but with the same key values for a Set index comparator, will not compare equal; both will be added to the set.  Document this, and add a test case.

texts:uv3 replace FsIndex_set_sorted, apply many fixes to replaced one
The first implementation of FsIndex_set_sorted assumed the underlying index was implemented by OrderedFsSet_array2.  This did a complex set of tradeoffs that improved insert/remove performance at the expense of more complex iteration. The OrderedFsSet_array2 impl was complex and was buggy (many bugs were removed, though, in this most recent commit).This implementation was based on "NavigableSet" apis, which required creation of multiple iterators as direction of iteration was reversed, and was quite complex.This change reverts both of these to a simpler more straight forward implementation, closer to how UIMA v2 did this, but with significant improvements in both iteration and insert/remove.  The underlying OrderedFsSet_array keeps the indexed items for one type in a compacted array, with free space possible at the begin and/or end, and rebalancing done as needed.  The iterator implementation removed several layers of indirection and is now implemented directly on top of the OrderedFsSet_array itself.

Given an iterator, there are two definitions of index size.  One is the size as seen by the iterator, which in v3, may not be the current index size (because iterators iterate over a view of the index at a particular point in time - either the time of iterator creation, or when a moveTo, moveToFirst, or moveToLast operation happens (except for snapshot iterators)).  The other size is the current size of the index (and any sub-type indexes). Change the name of the api to indicate this to reduce mistakes in the future.  Change uses which are incorrect (which need the current index size).

texts:DUCC: Serialization of AnalysisEngineProcessException fails in JP
If AE process() fails, the JP tries to serialize the exception before sending it to the JD. The AE throws a UIMA core AnalysisEngineProcessException which fails to serialize with:java.io.NotSerializableException: sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoaderIt turns out that this is caused by changes made to the InternationalizedException class as described in JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/UIMA-4793The fix discussed in the JIRA broke serialization of uima exceptions. The InternationalizedException  class contains a member variable of type ClassLoader which is not Serializable. For Ducc, the fix is to avoid Object serialization of the AnalysisEngineProcessException and use this instead:            StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();            t.printStackTrace(new PrintWriter(sw));            serializedCause =  sw.toString();where t = AnalysisEngineProcessException The entire stack trace is captured as a String then wrapped in a java RuntimeException and sent to the JD for logging. Also, add a new job to the DUCC_HOME/example/simple 1-error.job which forces AE to throw an error.

texts:uv3 remove positionUsesType from select api
The select API attempts to combine some of uimaFIT's capability for iterating.  The design included a configuration choice "positionUsesType".  This was implemented incorrectly for some cases, and it seems it would be hard to fix.  This Jira suggests removing it altogether.What it does: It affects two bits of iterator operation: moveTo(fs) - move to the leftmost item that "matches" fs for bounded iterators: skip the item which is "equal" to the bound.Details: The "matches" in 1) is based on the comparator for the index.  For Annotation indexes, this includes the typePriority.  However, the select API framework by default doesn't use type priorities (can be configured though). This means, if the underlying iterator is using type priorities, then doing a moveTo on it will move to a spot which might not be the "left-most" when type priorities are not used.  The correction for this has two flavors: depending on the setting of positionUsesType.  If not specified, the correction worked, and moved to the left-most same-begin-end-ignoring-type.  If specified, the correction was ignoring this, and a fix would need to scan in both directions to find the right type.  Although this could be done, it's complex.  And I think this is designing beyond a real need.  Use 2 is for skipping the bounding annotation when iterating (if it is in the index).  The normal mode for skipping is to skip only the item if it is == identical to the bounding annotation.  But (for UIMA v2 bounded iterator compatibility) a mode where the compare is done using the Annotation Comparator is provided.  The positionUsesType would narrow this equal test by also requiring that the types match.  I think this is unnecessarily complex, since I think most uses will be using the == style.So I propose to remove positionUsesType from the implementation / documentation.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: agent GC collector not reporting GC stats
Agent's child process GC collector not reporting stats sometimes. When agent launches a child process it also starts a GC collector which probes the remote MBeanServer for current garbage collector stats. The remote process sends an update to the agent which includes process JMX port. This port is used by the GC collector to connect to the remote. There is a race here: an agent can start GC collector before it receives JMX port from the remote. The current code establishes JMX connection in its constructor which is a bug. If it fails to connect, it silently goes on and keeps reporting 0 for GC stats. The fix is to improve logging to clearly identify what is happening. Since the collector is called on  a timer, it should always check its connection and try to establish it if a previous attempt failed.

The UIMA-AS aggregate merges type priorities from all delegates. When all delegates report back, the aggregate does not merge its type priorities. The consequence is that the aggregate's type priorities are clobbered due to this:aggregateMetadata.setTypePriorities(getCasManagerWrapper().getMetadata().getTypePriorities());In the above, the CasManager contains type priorities from all delegates only.When UIMA-AS client receives Meta from an aggregate service, the type priorities are missing if an aggregate was the only one that defined it. If type priorities are moved from aggregate to a delegate all is well since the merge successfully added them to the aggregate meta. The fix is to merge an aggregate type priorities with the delegate type priorities before callingaggregateMetadata.setTypePriorities(...);

texts:XmiCasDeserializer test doing invalid cas building - causes error in uv3
The XmiCasDeserializerTest does an invalid operation:  It runs two tests sequentially (in the same method), with a cas reset inbetween them.  But the first test creates two FSs which are held in Java local variables, and reused after the CAS has been reset (they were never recreated after the CAS was reset).This causes some strange behavior in Uima V3 (in its current state), which trips a runtime check.  The easy fix is to recreate the two FSs after the cas reset.Besides fixing the test case, maybe add a (maybe optional) catcher for these kinds of errors: something like detecting if a FS that was created in CAS nnn (where nnn is different for different CASs and different "resets" of the same CAS) is attempted to be set as a reference in another CASnnn.  Or maybe this is overdesign, since no one's complained...

texts:uv3 rework iterator use of typeOrder
Simplify the implementation of the feature of the select API to create iterators which can bypass type order.  Make a universal iterator(orderNotNeeded, ignoreType) API, pushing the implementation of these into the iterator framework (instead of subiterator impl). Change subiterator impl to focus on boundaries and iteration styles (strict, unambiguous, etc).  Change select API to use new iterator creation apis.

texts:some CAS deserializations skipping CAS Reset
The cas complete deserialization done by a test case in UIMA V3 had a strange failure caused by some caching that wasn't cleared (and was holding on to previously created 0-length primitive arrays shared by the JCas).Check all the CAS deserialization paths to insure that non-delta ones do a cas reset - to clear out possibly cached things.  And check if extra reset is needed when (re)installing type system, indexes, etc. - some is done in v3, not sure about v2..

texts:uv3 change way 0-length arrays are created, remove new (in v3) APIs for them
I rediscovered that some of the deserialization code (e.g. xmi deserialization) has been deserializing empty lists by reusing a shared instance (for a particular CAS) of an empty list.This seems like Java's sharing of other immutable objects, such as Integer (when you say new Integer(4), it returns you a shared object; likewise, strings like "123" are merged and shared where possible).The 3.0.0-beta had previously introduced a bunch of methods on CAS and JCas to get shared 0-length arrays and lists.  I'm think it would be good to remove all of these, and instead, just change the creation of these to automatically reuse shared (per CAS) instances of these.This has a small (tiny?) potential to "break" existing code, if  code was written that depended on two different instances of, for example, an FSArray of length 0, were required to be !=.A recovery mechanism (workaround) for these probably very rare cases would be to enable the creation of non-equal instances, perhaps via the clone() method.  Even this is probably not really needed, and deserialization would still be reusing shared values.

texts:uv3 change JCas feature slot initialization to be more lazy
The current implementation of JCas classes requires that a type system associated with a JCas class be committed before the JCas class is loaded.  This causes some existing code to fail, because they're causing a JCas class to be loaded before the type system is committed (see UIMA-5554).  The reason for this design in v3 was to enable the computation of the offsets for accessing features in feature structures to be done once and saved in static final int values, for efficiency. Find a new approach, which is as efficient, but is more lazy - allowing JCas classes to be loaded, and later a corresponding type system commit to be run.

texts:uv3 shorten api names for getting 0-length arrays/lists
There are new APIs to get shared (per CAS) instances of empty lists and arrays of various types.These APIs are called getEmpty/xxxx/List|Array  where xxxx can be blank or a type name part. (e.g. getEmptyFloatList).  These APIs are found in the CAS, the JCas, and on the various JCas classes for the type kinds (e.g., FloatList has a getEmptyList())Improve things by shortening these APIs uniformly by dropping the "get".  This will also align the style with how Java does this in its Collections class for empty instances.

texts:uv3: DocumentAnnotation subclasses not handled as in UIMAv2 during deserialization
Consider the case that you have custom subclass of the uima `DocumentAnnotation`, let's call it `DocumentMetaData`. Next, we have an XMI file which contains an annotation of the `DocumentMetaData` type.When loading such an XMI file in UIMAv2, the CAS ends up with a single `DocumentMetaData` annotation which is accessible via `cas.getDocumentAnnotation()`.When loading the same file with UIMAv3, the CAS ends up with both, a `DocumentAnnotation` and a `DocumentMetaData` annotation and `cas.getDocumentAnnotation()` returns the former.The same appears to happen when deserializing a CAS from various binary formats.

texts:uv3: NPE during deserialization under certain circumstances
This was previously thought to be covered by UIMA-5586 - however, the problem remains after the order of the deserialization had been fixed in UIMA-5586.When deserializing some binary CAS formats, there is a NPE in certain cases. Here is an example that might serve for reproduction:    @Test    public void test6LenientPlainUima() throws Exception    {        CAS source = JCasFactory.createJCas().getCas();        CAS target = JCasFactory.createJCas().getCas();        new DocumentMetaData(source.getJCas(), 0, 0).addToIndexes();        @SuppressWarnings("resource")        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();        CasIOUtils.save(source, bos, COMPRESSED_FILTERED);        bos.close();                CasIOUtils.load(new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray()), target);    }Mind this is a minimal code for reproduction. The same happens when deserializing within the context of an initialized AnalysisEngine.The NPE only seems to be thrown when the `DocumentMetaData` is added via JCas:java.lang.NullPointerException at org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASImpl.getView(CASImpl.java:2224) at org.apache.uima.cas.impl.BinaryCasSerDes6.deserializeAfterVersion(BinaryCasSerDes6.java:1892) at org.apache.uima.cas.impl.BinaryCasSerDes.reinit(BinaryCasSerDes.java:595) at org.apache.uima.util.CasIOUtils.load(CasIOUtils.java:382) at org.apache.uima.util.CasIOUtils.load(CasIOUtils.java:313) at org.apache.uima.util.CasIOUtils.load(CasIOUtils.java:237)        ...I have set up a similar test using only the plain CAS API which seems to work fine:    @Test    public void test6LenientPlainUima2() throws Exception    {        TypeSystemDescription tsd = new TypeSystemDescription_impl();        TypeDescription td = tsd.addType("DocumentMetaData", "", CAS.TYPE_NAME_DOCUMENT_ANNOTATION);        td.addFeature("feat", "", CAS.TYPE_NAME_STRING);                CAS source = CasCreationUtils.createCas(tsd, null, null, null);        CAS target = CasCreationUtils.createCas(tsd, null, null, null);        AnnotationFS dmd = source                .createAnnotation(source.getTypeSystem().getType("DocumentMetaData"), 0, 0);        source.addFsToIndexes(dmd);        assertEquals("DocumentMetaData", source.getDocumentAnnotation().getType().getName());        @SuppressWarnings("resource")        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();        CasIOUtils.save(source, bos, COMPRESSED_FILTERED);        bos.close();                CasIOUtils.load(new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray()), target);    }

texts:uv3 deserialize compressed form 4 sofas not being indexed correctly
Traced a strange bug to the deserialization for form 4 compressed - getting a NPE.  Root cause is the index info being deserialized is written with a conversion that changes the "address" of FSs to incrementing indexes (because they compress better).  But the serialization code doesn't do this for Sofas.  Mostly this doesn't matter by accident.  But the special test case done in DocumentAnnotation test trips this bug.Fix is in deserialization: after reading the sofa index number (which was written as v2 addresses, not converted to sequential) is to convert it to sequential so the rest of the code (which expects this) works.  In v2, not an issue, but an improvement was made in v3 which broke this.

Fix this, and see about getting the format to be identical (in most cases) to v2, for better backwards compatibility.

It seems as if there may be a bug in the way that CasCopier handles the documen annotation.

In my case, I do: create the target CAS add a document annotation (DocumentMetaData extends DocumentAnnotation) to the target CAS create the CasCopier with the source and target CAS copy several FSes but not the document annotationExpected: target CAS contains 1 DocumentMetaData annotationActual target CAS contains 2 DocumentMetaData annotationAlso, it seems that `isDocumentAnnotation` may not able to handle it if a CAS uses a custom subclass of DocumentAnnotation:  private <T extends FeatureStructure> boolean isDocumentAnnotation(T aFS) {    if (((TOP)aFS)._getTypeCode() != TypeSystemConstants.docTypeCode) {      return false;    }    if (srcCasDocumentAnnotation == null) {      srcCasDocumentAnnotation = srcCasViewImpl.getDocumentAnnotationNoCreate();     }    return aFS == srcCasDocumentAnnotation;  }

Forms like cas.getIndexRepository().getAllIndexedFSs(...) return an iterator.  It would be nice to be able to use the returned result in an extended for :   for (TOP x : cas.getInd... etc).  Add a new set of methods, getIndexedFSs( Type or JCas.class or nothing) to CAS/JCas and FSIndexRepository interfaces, that return Collections, without copying the index arrays, but just using them.  Make these copy-on-write style, so subsequent updates to the UIMA indexes won't affect the collection.  These can then be used in extended-for loops.Update internal uses of getAllIndexedFS (which does copy the indexes) to use the new style.

If kill -9 is sent by an agent while a child process is experiencing an OOM, the signal is not acted upon and the process remains running.An agent should retry kill -9 on regular basis (configured in ducc.properties) if a process is still standing after kill -9.

For situations where an interface is generically typed (e.g. FSIndex<T>), the generic spec for methods like select should have a param like <N extends T>, not <N extends FeatureStructure>.

texts:JCasUtil.selectAt has different meaning than expected
I was wondering what exactly the semantics of JCasUtil.selectAt is supposed to be after looking into the implementation, since the JavaDoc isn’t very precise. I initially thought that it would select annotations of the given type with the exact begin and end, but this is not the case when inspecting the implementation. The problem is in CasUtil.selectAt with the following while loop:while (it.isValid()) {  AnnotationFS a = it.get();  // If the offsets do not match the specified offets, we're done  if (a.getBegin() != aBegin && a.getEnd() != aEnd) {    break;  }  it.moveToNext();  list.add(a);}I would have expected that either begin or end must be different to drop the item, i.e. "if (a.getBegin() != aBegin || a.getEnd() != aEnd)" instead. This is obviously not the case, and it does not have the same behaviour like selectCovered either, so what is the intend if it’s not a bug?

Currently when JD/Protocol Handler runs out of work it returns null back in response to GET. In this case, the service wrapper sleeps for a fixed amount of time and tries again. The sleeping should be done in the client (JD/Protocol Handler) to reduce latency. Instead of waiting for a fixed amount of time, the client code can use notification/interrupt to wake up a sleeping GET thread when a new work items becomes available. The service wrapper will block in http get request until a reply comes or the get request times out. On timeout, the service will immediately call the client (JD/Protocol Handler).

For a while, we've had to run the "bundle" step for the uimaj-ep-jcasgenp and uimaj-ep-configurator eclipse plugins using maven-bundle-plugin version 2.3.7, which is an old release of the bundle plugin.  If run with more current versions, no errors are reported, and the build works OK, but the subsequent build of the eclipse-update-site drops these two plugins when running the features-and-bundles-publishing step.  The workaround was to use the older version of the maven-bundle-plugin.By trial and error, found the fix for this was changing the <Import-package clause to keep the line having just "*" as the last line.  This involved reordering the lines following this up before this.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Agent JMX connection retry not working
When an agent looses a JMX connection to a remote service it does not try to recover it. Instead just reports 0's for GC values.The problem is that it checks connection for null and only if true the reconnect happens. In the failing scenario, the connection is established and works for awhile than the connection fails due to a long GC in the service. The connection object is stale (not null) at this point and reconnect does not happen.When a JMX failure occurs set the connection object to null forcing a subsequent reconnect. When the JMX fails to fetch GC info the GC collection should set GC values to -1. This info will be sent to Duccmon where the failure can be visualized. Perhaps changing color of GC value to red could alert a user.

texts:uv3 support CAS deserialization subsequent low level access
Some users depend 1) constant v2-ids for FSs preserved in deserialization and serialization, and 2) low level cas API access to these.V3 normally doesn't maintain tables linking ids to FSs, as these prevent GC of unreachable FSs. Based on a mode, set by -Duima.default_v2_id_references, and also controllable per CAS instance, support the use of id's in the same way V2 did, with better support for more serialization/deserializations. Feature Structures when created are added to the internal id-to-FeatureStructure map, enabling the LowLevelCAS apis to work. IDs are assigned so that mimic what they would be in V2 Serialization is altered to include unreachable Feature Structures for those serialization forms where this is the v2 worked.  Forms like Xmi, XCAS, and compressed binary serialization form 6 only serialized reachable featrue structures in v2, and for backwards compatibility, this is continued.

texts:uv3 add semibuiltin map from int -> fs
Some applications find it so convenient to have a map from ints to FSs, that they use the low level CAS APIs, and the fs's v2 "address" for this.  In v3, use of the low level APIs in this manner disables garbage collection, as there is no way to clear the map.Support an alternative way to have int -> FS maps, under user control of what exactly gets added to them, supporting removes, and clearing under application control, by implementing a new semi-built-in type

texts:UIMA-AS: fix JMS listener recovery after broker restart
There is a race when trying to recover lost JMS connection which sometimes prevents the service from recovering correctly. When JMS listeners loose connection to a broker, they are entering retry mode where connection attempt is made. When one listener gets a valid Session, other listener's Sessions become invalid which triggers another connection retry invaliding Session of another JMS Consumer. This continues in a loop. Make sure only one listener is doing the recovery. Other threads block until the first one recovers and test the connection and if OK will refresh Session using a new connection.

texts:uv3 previous call in list style iterators not quite right
Java has a ListIterator interface, which defines previous() and next() such that repeated operations of next(), previous(), ... return the same item.  This means that the next impl returns the current item and then advances the position, while the previous impl decrements the position (first) and then returns that item.  v3 added impl of ListIterator to fsIterator, but implemented this backwards for previous.  Change this to comply with the definition in listIterator.  Also, change other list-iterator like things. that have the same issue.  This change should not cause backwards compatibility issues, because v2 didn't implement ListIterator interface for FsIterators.

texts:Support for application specified logging facility
.Applications embedding the UIMA C++ runtine need to be able to route  log messages generated by the C++ framework and by UIMA C++ componenets to logging facilities used by the application. Currently, the UIMA C++ SDK only supports logging to a file and routing log messages to Java if called from a  Java application.  To support this requirement to support custom loggers, the SDK will be extended as follows:1)  define a Logger interface to be implemented by users to wrap the application specific logger.2)  provide APIs in the ResourceManager class to register/unregister Loggers. The ResourceManager will maintain reference to       all the registered loggers.3) modify the LogFacility class to route the log messages to all registered loggers.4) reimplement the current logging to file and java logger to conform to this design.

texts:uv3 create type systems with JCas features merged in
Some use cases involve setting up (over time) multiple CASs with similar but not identical type systems, differing in the number of features the types have.  The use case for this also has JCas class definitions defining features.  The following currently fails: load type T with no features, load JCas for T with features f1, f2, f3.  This works correctly. Now load type T with features f1, f2, f3, using the same classloader that loaded the JCas for T previously.  This fails because the offsets for f1, f2, f3 in the JCas were computed previously, and cannot be changed (because existing instances of the JCas class for T would stop working).Implement a fix for this that works by having the initial setup of the JCas feature offsets be preceeded by a step which, prior to committing the type system, loads the JCas classes and programmatically adds in to the type system any features defined in the JCas but not in the Type system.Include logging messages showing what's happening.

texts:uv3 add better message when alpha02 version of JCas is found
The approach for assigning adjusted offset slots in alpha02 doesn't work in the current release due to redesign.  If JCas classes, generated for alpha02, but not updated for beta or later are being used, they fail, with a poor message.Remove the (now non-working) bit of support code for alpha02 and improve the error message to say the JCas class needs to be rebuilt for the current version of UIMA.

When merging in features from JCas definitions, sometimes the range is unknown.  In this case null is used, but that cannot be assigned to the rangetypeclass which is an int.  Use the feature structure ref default instead.

texts:uv3 handle migration from alpha levels of JCas classes more gracefully
Alpha levels of JCas classes call TypeSystemImpl.getAdjustedFeatureOffset(...) as part of the initialization for features.  This approach was changed for beta and later levels, and this API if used throws an exception (saying it's an old alpha level construct). Change this to a) not throw an exception, but just issue a warning, and b) return -1, which, if it really is an old jcas class, at run time, if this feature is referenced, it will cause an exception.This will let people successfully migrate from v3 alpha levels by running for example JCasGen from the Component Description Editor.

texts:uv3 have ComponentDescriptorEditor not load user JCas classes
Richard noticed that the Component Descriptor Editor (CDE) was loading user-defined JCas classes.  This may cause problems while editing, if the edits result in some structural change (super class inheritance for example) which invalidates the "offsets" assigned when JCas classes are loaded.There's no need to load these classes, due to the running of the Component Descriptor Editor, because the only reason they were loaded in the first place was as part of Cas Creation, which  in turn was only done to "validate" the Component Descriptor, not to run it.Add a capability to have the CDE create CASs without loading user-defined JCas classes.

texts:uv3 cache some logging info
Messages which get "bundles" currently look up the bundle resource using Java's mechanisms, and a special class loader.  The Java mechanisms look up the bundles in multiple bundle names - using suffixes for locales.  The special class loader does 3 kinds of searching (if not found in the current class loader):  1) for UIMA Resources, it uses a resource-specific classpath (see UIMA-3692, UIMA-4793 ), and the thread local (if one is present) and then it looks up the call stack and uses any found class loader associated with the call stack frames.  This can be quite expensive.  Update the localizeMessage in I18nUtil to cache the resource bundle (by thread), and avoid this lookup for every message.When a lookup is done, change the order of the special class loader to move the look-up-the-call-stack to follow the other two (using the Resource-specified classloader, using the threadLocal classloader).

texts:UIMA-DUCC: fix XStream warning msgs
After upgrading xstream to 1.4.10 (bundled with AMQ 5.15.2) msgs are dumped to stdout when running various ducc things:"Security framework of XStream not initialized, XStream is probably vulnerable."Seeing these when running ducc_submit. Also in JD log. The new XStream is configured by default  to run without security but dumps the above every time xml serialization/deserialization is done. All is working fine except for these warning msgs.The simplest way to fix that is to override XStream defaults and to whitelist everything. I actually tried that by changing XStreamUtils and DuccEventHttpDispatcherCl. No more annoying msgs.Perhaps a better (more secure way) is to white list specific classes/packages when serializing/deserializing ducc msgs. This may take time to get it right. We need to list all types which are allowed including java classes. I think we only serialize DUCC classes (event classes) + java primitives + java collections (Map, Lists, etc)

The GET asks the client for a task (CAS), the ACK confirms service receipt of it, and END indicates the task completion.To complete a task, a client may need a correlation Id to locate the task in its database. Modify the protocol handler API to allow for user code to attach the correlation ID and include it in a reply. The pull service should echo this correlation Id in subsequent ACK and END messages. Modify TAS callbacks onTaskSuccess() and onTaskFailure() to include correlation object. Also the getSerializedCAS() method should somehow return the correlation object along with a serialized CAS.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Create a new project for the pull service
Currently, Ducc's pull service is made up of classes from common, transport, user, and container projects. Its transport and protocol handler are fixed in the code. No way to plug in alternatives. The service is configured via -D's and env vars. Such approach prevents collocating multiple services in the same JVM. The proposal is to move/refactor transport, protocol handler related classes to a new project uima-ducc-pullservice. Also, move/refactor wrapper code which deploys UIMA aggregate pipelines. The new project will be self contained with no dependency on other Ducc projects/jars. It will have dependency on UIMA, HttpClient, and Jetty.The new code will allow an application to instantiate as many instances of a service as it needs. It will allow to plugin custom ProtocolHandler, ErrorHandler, and ServiceMonitor with default implementation for these provided.

texts:Unable to extract features when annotation ends with HTML tag
If there is an annotation that covers the whole sofa string, and the sofa string ends with an HTML tag, it seems like RUTA isn't able to extract the features for that annotation. For instance, lets suppose this document (represented as XMI): // XMI document<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><xmi:XMI xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:cas="http:///uima/cas.ecore" xmlns:tcas="http:///uima/tcas.ecore" xmlns:types="http:///com/acme/uima/types.ecore" xmi:version="2.0"><cas:NULL xmi:id="0"/><tcas:DocumentAnnotation xmi:id="8" sofa="1" begin="0" end="12" language="es"/><types:MyDocument xmi:id="14" sofa="1" begin="0" end="12" documentId="test_docsize_39d5541c-5e7f-391c-95af-c82ce6306644"/><cas:Sofa xmi:id="1" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="ABCDEFGHIJ&lt;p&gt;"/><cas:View sofa="1" members="8 14"/></xmi:XMI>And the following RUTA script:  // RUTA scriptSTRING documentId = "Unknown";com.acme.uima.types.MyDocument{-> GETFEATURE("documentId", documentId)};LOG("Starting to process document: " + documentId);The LOG action will output Unknown. But as soon as the string doesn't end with an HTML tag, it works fine. Any ideas what could be going on?

texts:UIMA: need a way to lock a CAS to prevent user from releasing it prematurely
UIMA-AS client supports an async style of sending CASes for processing to a remote service. When using sendCAS( CAS aCas), the code serializes CAS and dispatches it to the remote but keeps the CAS in a cache. When a reply comes, the cached CAS is used to deserialize a response. The contract is that the user code should not call CAS.release(). When a reply finally comes, the CAS is handed over to an application callback and upon return from the callback, the UIMA-AS releases the CAS. Problem: there is nothing to prevent user code to violate the contract. If CAS.release() is called while UIMA-AS client awaits reply (or during reply deserialization), bad things happen. In a specific use case, a NPE was thrown during deserialization and debugging was quite painful.Proposed solution: to protect integrity of a CAS need a way to lock/unlock it. Such facility can be added to CASImpl class. When a user code tries to call release()  when a CAS is locked,  the code should throw an exception (IllegalStateException or similar). WDYT?

texts:Performance problem MARKTABLE when matching case insensitive
Hi,We encounter a performance issue (or maybe infinitive loop) when we use the MARKTABLE action, with case insenstive valuelists.The call in our script is:ADDRETAINTYPE(WS);MARKTABLE(LawName, 1, 'nl_law_names.ignorecase.csv', true, 0, "", 0, "lawIdentifier" = 2);Using the following input fragment will result in a timeout exception after 1 minute.Groenboek COM(2006) 105 definitief een Europese strategie voor duurzame, concurrerende en continu geleverde energie voor Europa {SEC(2006)317}That complete name is a Dutch lawname and also be an entry of the nl_law_names.csv file.When we try to match it and we have the ignoreCase flag to false, it is no problem and fast.. If we toggle that flag to true (case is ignored), the matching is really slow or even hanging in an infinitive loop.I debugged the code and pinpoint me to the TreeWordList class. The recursive method recursiveContains have a potential bug. I think that the problem is when the item have a special character, that it is the same character in upper and lowercase. The recursive method will then look/fork twice on the same tree item.I made a fix that checks if the uppercase character is the same as the lowercase character, and in that case it only do the recursive call once. That solved the (performance) issue but I'm not sure if this is really the main problem and the current fix is the best fix for this.

texts:Incorrect feature assignment on MARKTABLE because incorrect record can be used
Feature assignment with MARKTABLE can go wrong. Let assume that we have a CSV table with the following entries:MatchingIDFirst Item1Second Item2SECOND ITEM3and we use the MARKTABLE action so that we match on the first column and assign the second column to a feature of the annotaion.If we do the match case sensitive and we use the following input as document: "SECOND ITEM" the annotation will get "2" as feature value.The MARKTABLE action match correct on "SECOND ITEM". In the next step it tries to set the features. Therefore it call the getRowWhere method on the (csv) table to get the related row in the table.The code in the getRowWhere method always compare the tableValue and lookup value lowercase and that will result in the record with "Second Item" in it. That's incorrect because we need the one with  "SECOND ITEM". I modified the code so that it first start with an exact match. If no matching item is found and we ignore case it will also do a case insensitive check.

A long-outstanding request from uimaFIT is to incorporate the Thread's context class loader in the uima class loader's lookup scheme. see UIMA-5054Doing this would allow uimaFIT to no longer create individual class loaders for each AnalysisEngine its factory produces.  This would alleviate UIMA-5801.Current logic: see if already loaded by this loader, if so return with that try loading it, if succeed, return with that delegate to the parent.Fix logic: same except for a step between 2 and 3:      2a. delegate to the Thread context class loader (if available), if succeed, return with thatBesides doing this for loading classes, it would also be done for getting resources.Does anyone see any issues with this approach?It seems this is unneeded; if the thread context class loader is wanted in the chain, it should be the parent.  The suggested approach seems to address a non-issue where 2 parent chains are wanted.There are other approaches to prevent multiple class loaders ( and even maybe, multiple ResourceManagers) from being created, which might be a better solution for UIMA-5801.  See comments for this and UIMA-5801.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: agent should support quiesce request
Currently when an agent receives a stop request through its admin channel it sends SIGTERM to all its running processes and waits 1 minute for them to stop. Any process still standing after 1 minute is than killed via SIGKILL. In addition to stop request, an agent should support a quiesce request (through an admin channel). When such request is received, an agent should send SIGTERM to all its running processes but should not send SIGKILL to allow each process to finish its tasks and exit when done. An agent should not start a timer after sending the SIGTERM.In quiesce mode, an agent will reject new process allocation requests from the OR. Such process state will be marked as REJECTED and published to the OR. An agent will keep publishing metrics and inventory. In an event an agent process does not exit, a sys admin can send a stop request to force termination.In addition to changes in an agent, modifications are also needed in the RM, perhaps OR, CLI and scripts.

texts:Order in SelectFS
I'm not sure about the way that order in SelectFS is handled. Naively, I would expect that all operations return annotations in index order or in reverse index order if `backwards` was called. But for example `jcas.select(Sentence.class).between(t1, t2).asList()` returns in normal order if `t1 < t2` and in backwards order if `t2 < t1`. While I this seems to be a nice touch from the engineering point of view, from a naive user's perspective, it seems somewhat surprising to me. Mind that the behavior is documented - still I wonder it if is a good idea. If I wanted to have the annotations in reverse order, I'd probably try calling `jcas.select(Sentence.class).backwards().between(t1, t2).asList()` or maybe `jcas.select(Sentence.class).between(t1, t2).backwards().asList()`.

texts:Reduce noisy output when running some CPE tests when run in Maven
Many CPE tests use ManageOutputDevice.setAllSystemOutputToNirvana() calls to attempt to stop expected error output from flooding the console.  This works when the tests are run from Eclipse, but fails when run from Maven.  This because the mechanism used is to swap in to System.err and System.out new print streams that throw away their output.  However, if any logging occurs previous to this, the logger will initialize and copy the System.err, for example, so that subsequent setting of it has no effect on logging.  When running from Maven, this happens.The fix is to use a different mechanism to stop the output due to logging:  UIMAFramework.getLogger().setLevel(Level.OFF).  Ideally this is surrounded by a try / finally block to insure it's put back to INFO.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Agent not stopping child process metrics collector sometimes
An agent starts a time based camel route for each JP it launches. This route wakes a thread and collects metrics for the child process. This happens at regular intervals. When a child process terminates, the agent should stop associate route. In some cases routes keep running and accumulating in memory causing a leak which lead to OOM. Modify code to force route termination when the process is dead yet agent keeps trying to collect metrics for it.

This Jira covers experimental, disabled code done as an experiment to explore performance implications of putting in barriers in a UIMA pipeline, so that multiple threads would wait at the barrier until a bunch of them had arrived, and then they would be released together. The intuition motivating this was that in highly multi-threaded machines, running the same annotators together, might improve locality-of-reference for l1/l2/l3 memory caches, potentially speeding up execution.After one set of experiments which failed to show improvement (for possibly many reasons, not yet investigated), this code is disabled, but kept in the project in case of future interest.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: the WS broker health checker should create new connection
Current broker health checker in the WS uses Camel's producer to send JMS pings to itself. This producer is optimized to use Connection factory and reuse existing connections. Although this is efficient, it does not test an important scenario where a broker keeps serving existing connections but refuses to accept new ones.So to test broker viability the health checker should create new broker connection for every ping. Spring's JmsTemplate provides such function. Modify Camel route in WebServerConfiguration code to not publish pings. This route should continue to run on the timer but the ping should be dispatched by new code in WebServerStateProcessor.process().This code will use JmsTemplate to publish WebServerStateDuccEvent to the WS topic

Parent-pom 12 is modified to generate .sha512 checksums.   Due to a bug in the rules for repository.apache.org, these cannot be uploaded unless they (the checksums) are gpg-signed.  Although there's an issue to fix this INFRA-14923 , the work is currently stalled. In the meantime, modify the parent-pom to gpg sign and attach the signatures, for .sha512 checksums.

texts:DUCC ducc_post_install should verify that required /usr/bin/nslookup exists
DUCC may appear to install and start, but Database will be "down".  This is because when system command /usr/bin/nslookup is not present OR will not properly create and maintain its orchestrator_properties_table, which ducc-mon reads to tell if DB is alive.Therefore, ducc_post_install should fail if /usr/bin/nslookup is not present.  OS is not config'd enough!  Use, for example, yum -y install "bind-utils" to add missing executable to Red Hat 7 install.

texts:workaround broken invoker transitivity when releasing
The jcasgen-maven-plugin integration tests fail when doing a release:prepare, if the local .m2 doesn't have the non-snapshot versions of dependencies for uimaj projects.I think during release:prepare, the version is modified from e.g. 2.10.3-SNAPSHOT to 2.10.3, and the projects are built but not installed to the .m2 - they're just kept in the maven "reactor".  The maven-invoker-plugin "install" goal, which is supposed to set up a local-repo (used just for testing) with the specified artifacts and their dependencies fails to find the dependencies if they're in the reactor, and findable via normal artifact lookup in the local .m2 and /or remote repositories. This causes the integration tests to fail, but only when running release prepare (again, because this goal is not installing the build artifacts to the local .m2).This seems new behavior - this used to work; I think it's likely related to maven or maven plugin upgrades.Workaround: explicitly put all the dependencies from the uimaj project as "top level" dependencies, and not depend on the transitive resolution mechanism.  If they're lists at the top level, the invoker:install does find them in the reactor and adds them.

A user has reported getting not-found when trying to load resources in a Tomcat environment, while the same application works fine when run as a separate application.Change the logic for finding UIMA resources via class loaders to consider, if a UIMA Extension class loader is not specified, the Thread Local Context Class Loader.  If that is used, and the resource is not found, for backwards compatibility, try to find using the system class loader.

UIMA-5754 changed how the bootstrap class loader sets up class path, because after Java 9, it is no longer possible to add classes to the application classpath.  This change breaks how dd2spring sets up the classpath for saxon.  It needs to set this up with a special extra class loader which implements the logic of trying the thread-local context class loader, but if a resource is not found there, then trying the classloader used to load the uima classes (which is no longer the application class loader, which is the value of the ThreadLocal context ClassLoader.

texts:UIMA-AS: Make Shutdown hooks optional
In BaseUIMAAsynchronousEngine_impl a shutdown hook gets added to the Runtime which stops the AsynchronousEngine. This makes it impossible for consumers to correclty implement a graceful shutdown behaviour on JVM shutdow. For applications running on Kubernetes the expectation is that on "SIGTERM" the application completes running requests and then exits. SIGTERM also triggers JVM shutdown hooks, the AS shutdown hooks prevent running requests from completing (because the AS Engine is stopped).It also seems like these hooks are never removed which might lead to issues if a lot of AS Engines are initialized.It would be benefitial to make these shutdown hooks optional or remove them outright.

If an annotation type has a feature which range is a subtype of string (https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-3.0.0/references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.type_system.string_subtypes ) the usual feature assignments in e.g. CREATE calls do not work. They are not set due to the RutaStream::assignFeatureValue method not having an appropriate case for these range types.In the JCas cover classes however, the features can be directly set with strings.If not setting the feature value is not intended Ruta behavior, I attached a patch that might fix that issue. On my end, this works with all feature assignment methods.

texts:Eclipse Update Site for 2.10.2 needs dist svn tag
While checking the eclipse update site for uimaj 2.10.3 after jar-signing the plugins/features, I noticed that although the update site has both the 2.10.2 and 2.10.3 jars, the Eclipse FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher only generated the contents/artifacts jars with the metadata for the 2.10.3.  This wasn't an issue when running the same process for uv3 3.0.1.The consequence: when installing, if you uncheck the box to show just the most recent version, the 2.10.2 version doesn't show up.My educated guess is that this might be caused by having switched the minimum JVM level for 2.10.3 from Java 7 to Java 8, and the Eclispe FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher disallowing mixing of JVM minimum level requirements.  To work around this, I'm planning on doing an "svn tag" on the Eclipse update site for uimaj to create a separately addressable update site for the 2.10.2 (in case anyone needs that).  In the news article and website download page, I'll add a note about this.

These methods are now part of Java 8 and it would be better to use these instead. Since the methods are part of the public API they need to be deprecated first before they can be removed. This will give our users some time to migrate to the Java 8 methods as well.

It seems the eclipse udpate site for uv3 has the unsigned jars.  The site works, but asks the user to accept unsigned jars.  Testing using the built-and-signed jars works without that annoyance.  It appears these were never uploaded for uv3.

The try-with-resources statement allows writing code dealing with resources in a more compact way. It is no longer necessary to write finally blocks by hand. This patch replaces as many as possible try statements with the try-with-resources statement.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: improve pull service http client error handling
The pull service error handling in HttpServiceTransport.dispatch() is not optimal. While it is catching and handling some exceptions likeNoHttpResponseExceptionHttpHostConnectExceptionUnknownHostExceptionits not handling other ones that HttpClient.execute() may throw. Simplify handling of exceptions from HttpClient.execute() by simply catching any IOException and automatically retry until success. The HttpClient.execute() API is documented as:HttpResponse org.apache.http.client.HttpClient.execute(HttpUriRequest request) throws IOException, ClientProtocolException Note: the ClientProtocolException is a kind of (extends from) IOExceptionAlso, the http client may succeed but returns status code != 200. In such case, we should also retry.

texts:Destroy the ResourceManager on destroy of a pear
This bug is related to bug UIMA-5799 . The bug seems not completely fixed, since the files are still being accessed after trying to delete them. This behavior can be shown by the tool 'lsof' (see screenshot). There seems still access to the resources of a pear on the file system, which denies the complete deletion on the file system after uninstalling it (they are marked as deleted but are not actually removed). Potential cause:The class PearAnalysisEngineWrapper creates and caches resource managers. The elements in that Cache (Java map) are never explicitly removed, not even in the destroy method.

Pull service is not polling for tasks correctly. Currently it allows threads to send GET requests concurrently. With many services running each with many threads the driver may get easily overrun. Instead each service should allow one GET request at a time. So there is only one thread pulling task at a time. Other threads block until a thread receives a task. If no task is given, a single thread will retry until a task becomes available or service is stopped. There will be no waiting on the driver/client side.

texts:uv3 unnecessary API change from v2 breaking binary compatibility
Uima v3 strives to be binary compatible with v2, with the exception of needing new JCas classes.  This allows a simpler migration because (the goal is) you don't need to recompile JARs - the same Jars can be used with either v2 or v3.Found a few spots where v3 changed the signature of a public API, usually to a more specific type, which, while correct, breaks binary compatibility.  Reverse these changes.

texts:uv3 support additional JCas / type system use case
UIMA allows multiple pipelines having multiple type systems to be run under one single class loader.  Sometimes these type systems have somewhat different versions.  When JCas is used (within one class loader) there can only be one instance of the JCas class definition. The implementation attempts to make variations work, but missed one:The following use case is throwing an exception, but should be supported:Given:  JCas class S defining feature F JCas class T having S as its super class Type system defining Uima Type S with feature FWhen this is committed, the JCas classes are loaded; and the "slot" for feature F is allocated in S.Now have another type system defined with UIMA Type T having feature F, and supertype S.This was throwing an exception.  This might occur in practice when a slot is migrated from a subtype to a supertype in some (but not all) instances of type system definitions being run (typically in different UIMA pipelines, running together in one JVM within one class loader).Have this work, by setting the slot offset for this type be the slot for F defined in the SuperType S.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Uima version detection not working
Before deploying a child process, an agent tries to determine which version of uima user wants to run with. It takes user specified classpath and loads the jars and resources into a Classloader. Using the Classloader it tries to instantiate UimaVersion class from uima-core.jar. The bug is that an agent tries to load the jar as user ducc. When the jar is located in a place which is not readable to ducc, the operation fails with:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.uima.impl.UimaVersion         at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:610)         at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassHelper(ClassLoader.java:925)         at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:870)         at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:853)         at org.apache.uima.ducc.agent.launcher.DuccCommandExecutor.getDeployableCommandLine(DuccCommandExecutor.java:819)         at org.apache.uima.ducc.agent.launcher.DuccCommandExecutor.exec(DuccCommandExecutor.java:142)         at org.apache.uima.ducc.agent.launcher.CommandExecutor.call(CommandExecutor.java:226)         at org.apache.uima.ducc.agent.launcher.CommandExecutor.call(CommandExecutor.java:36)         at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:277)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1160)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:635)         at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:812) Also, in case a user fails to provide uima-core.jar and the code fails as shown above, set the reason for failure so it is clear in duccmon why the process failed.

When using the cas compare to discover the root cause of two CASs miscomparing, it is helpful to exclude showing miscompares that are caused by already reported miscompares. For example, if you have some collection of Feature Structures, and one of them miscompares and you report that, it is helpful to not also report the two collections are miscomparing.  If you don't exclude these "upper level" miscompares from reporting, there are typically so many reported miscompares, that it's hard to focus on the root cause.Also, remove code that was conditionally sorting some collections during compare - this broke other code and isn't needed - any sorting should be done before this routine is called.

texts:uv3 deserialization of typed arrays could be faulty in edge case
UIMA has some limited support for typed arrays.  These are declared in type system descriptors by including an elementType specification for a feature whose range is FSArray.See http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.type_system.featuresThe XCAS and the Xmi serialization forms serialize these as FSArray.  The deserialization code, when deserializing these, looks at the feature declaration to see if it has an elementType, and if so, changes the type of the Feature Structure to that type.  This is fine except for two cases:1) backwards compatibility - this wasn't done in v2.  This might be an ignorable difference (except for utilities that compare CASs, and don't accommodate this).2) (more important) Sometimes feature structures are "shared" - that is, multiple different features might reference the same one.  These features might not have the same element type.  A not unusual use case is the one where the item being referenced is a 0-length Feature Structure, and the code is sharing one common (immutable) instance of this. For #2, one possible fix is to examine the "multipleReferencesAllowed" property of the feature, and only do this narrowing of the type if this is false, and the rest of the code hasn't accidentally shared this feature structure with other references.For #1, perhaps the right approach is to have a backwards compatibility -D flag that (if set) avoids doing this type update when deserializing.

With the conversion of FSArray into Generic FSArray<> the JCasGen process does not handle the Generic type properly and will cause extensive warnings in application code.The 4 methods generating warnings are:xXXX - Feature name, Generic - generic type public FSArray getXXX() { *...* } public void setXXX(FSArray v) { ... }     public Generic getXXX(int i) { ... } public void setXXX(int i, Generic v) { ... }

How to reproduce the issue:1) Create a new collection reader using the Eclipse Plugin.2) Select a implementation class.3) Import a type descriptor by name.4) Save the descriptor.This should result in an error message saying that the descriptor is invalid, because it can not find the type descriptor.I have tried that with several valid descriptors (that work perfectly well when processed in a CPE), all giving the same error.

texts:UIMA-DUCC: Fix race in agent
There is a race condition in agent which leads to incorrect process reporting in Duccmon. In this scenario the following happened: agent started JP JP reported Initializing state which agent then publishes to the OR JP reported Running state but immediately after died due to process error. The agent detected process termination (before publishing Running to OR) and changed state to failed with reason UnknownThe result is that the OR thinks that the JP died while Initializing since Running state was never published. There is a small window where the race can occur.

texts:External DTD usage in XML descriptors disabled during build revision upgrade
Between version 2.10.1 and 2.10.2 the XMLParser configuration was changed (fixed, without the possibility to adjust it) to not allow for DTD and its loading from external file.This is done in XMLUtils.createSAXParserFactory() which sets the DISALLOW_DOCTYPE_DECL and LOAD_EXTERNAL_DTD feature. Before the SAXParserFactory was created without adjusting these features.While I understand that this was done to prevent malicious XML from doing nasty things, the kind how it was done is problematic: the change happened in a revision build, no major or minor number change it was not documented one cannot simply change it back like using an environment variable, method call etc. - the only workaround is to do a problematic sub-classing of XMLParser_impl with additional configuration etc.We use the DTDs for CPE descriptors quite a lot to have the descriptor in modular chunks using entities etc. Thus it is important (for the time being) to use DTD there - and we know that the XML is not problematic.Because this feature (DTD) is crucial I have marked this as a BUG since such changes should not occur in a build upgrade or it should at least be possible to get the old behavior easily back.

texts:UIMA Ruta SeedLexer throws Error instead of exception
The SeedLexer and possibly other related classes used by Ruta throw java.lang.Error instead of java.lang.Exception. This is usually only thrown by the JVM when it’s really impossible to continue the process, e.g. out of memory, linkage errors or fatal VM failures, and it therefore not meant to be caught under normal circumstances, so most runtime environment don't capture these. This can therefore cause the whole process to fail instead of just the document being processed.It would therefore be preferable if these components throw a type of java.lang.Exception instead, so that the process can proceed with the next document without the need to hook into the runtime core and catch java.lang.Error. The errors are also not subclassed, so it's awkward to distinguish them by checking for the message string itself.

texts:FSIndexComparatorImpl.equalsWithoutType() gets slow for many CASes with the same TS
When creating several hundred CASes with the same type system, the `shareExisting` mechanism which is designed to save on memory starts eating into CPU time quite a lot.This screenshot shows that in my particular case, the method is called ~11mio times and takes the bulk of the processing time. The call hierarchy is a bit messed up though - actually this happens when the CASes are initialized. The second screenshot shows the actual call hierarchy, but for some reason, the profile doesn't properly dive into the `equals` method here and doesn't count the time spent in `equalsWithoutType`. ! So either the method shouldn't be called that often - or - it should be way faster.In the example, I have like 1800 CAS instances and their type system has upwards of 200 types.

texts:Class loading issue with ResourceBundle when using the UIMAClassloader
currently we have the issue with UIMA components that custom messages in exception cannot be resolved when the UIMAClassloader is used to load the custom component. This is the case when using the PEAR runtime. To work around this issue we say that the custom components can throw own exception class that is derived from the UIMA exception classes. This should work because we thought that the method ResourceBundle.|getBundle(baseName, locale) |use the Classloader of the current object to resolve the messages. That's also what the JavaDoc says:"Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name and locale, and the caller's class loader.Calling this method is equivalent to calling |getBundle(baseName, locale, this.getClass().getClassLoader())| ...."But unfortunately this is not true in any case. So it does also not work for out UIMA case.If we have the custom exception example below, let's see what happens.public MyException extends AnnotatorPrcoessException {  public MyException (String aMessageKey, Object[] aArguments) {     super("myExceptionMessages", aMessageKey, aArguments);  }}when the exception message is localized, the method getLocalizedMessage() is called on the MyException object. The getLocalizedMessage() method is not implemented in the MyException class, it is inherited from the InternationalizedException class.     public String getLocalizedMessage() {     ....     ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, locale);     ....   }If getLocalizedMessage() method is called, the getBundle(bundleName, locale) method resolves the classloader that is used to resolve the bundleName. In our case the classloader of the class InternationalizedException is used here since there the getLocalizedMessage() method is defined. But this is in case of the UIMAClassloader usage not the classloader of the MyException object that should be used here, at least if we trust the JavaDocs. To solve this issue we can easily hand over the MyException object classloader to the getBundle() method like:   ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, locale, this.getClass().getClassloader());The fix is done in the InternationalizedException class so it work for all derived exceptions.

texts:CustomResourceFactory_impl not catching exceptions when calling out to initialize method
While testing the CDE, found an instance where a custom resource was incorrectly configured (things were missing that it needed in the class path).  The result of this was a silent failure to start the CDE editor, although an entry was noted in the Eclipse error log.  This was because the missing class path caused a NoClassDefFound exception to be thrown, but nobody (except the top-most Eclipse UI code) caught it.I think the right place for putting a try/catch is around the point in the CustomResourceFactory where it calls out to that resource's "initialize" method.  If that throws an exception, it should be caught and wrapped with a new ResourceInitializationException, which says that the nested exception happened while trying to initialize the custom resource, and identifying the custom resource.

If, e.g., an OOME is thrown inside a primitive AE, the CAS is not unlocked and can't be reused.  This is an issue when the application is trying to recover from the OOME.  The call to restoreClassLoaderUnlockCas() in PrimitiveAnalysisEngine_impl.callAnalysisComponentProcess() either needs to be moved to the finally clause, or the CAS needs to be unlocked separately there.  Looks like this is a bug introduced with the class loading changes for 2.1.Reproduce by provoking an OOME in CVD (start with little memory, use large document etc).  CVD will catch OOM.  Now try to rerun AE, will fail because CAS is locked.

Currently, every time you run eclipse:eclipse, the parent POM is configured for the life-cycle phase of generate-resources to run an ant script to copy the LICENSE, NOTICES, and DISCLAIMER files into the source tree, and because eclipse:eclipse runs the phases up to "generate-resources" (see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/eclipse-mojo.html where it says: "Invokes the execution of the lifecycle phase generate-resources prior to executing itself."), these files end up in the source tree, and need to be manually deleted.Change this to the maven-way of doing this:  add a <resources> element to the parent POM that is configured to add these files to the meta-inf of the result.Adam said that he tried this earlier, and got strange failures.  I just tried it and it seems to work now.  I ran the whole build, both install and assembly:assembly.

Language specifications in capabilities are compared frequently in the operation of the UIMA Framework.

This should be done uniformly, when the language specification is initially parsed, for performance reasons.  A suggested normalization would be something like         language.toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).replace('_','-')

Remove CapabilityContainer and switch usage of it to the Result Spec, for space/time efficiency reasons.

Capability Language Flow uses the declared output capabilities (and input capabilities) to compute the flow.  In the rest of UIMA, saying a type T is output means include subtypes of T (e.g., the result specificaiton says subtypes of T should be produced).  However the logic in Capability Language Flow only uses information that is explicitly declared in the output capability specification (and input capabilities) when determining the flow, without considering subtyping.  Check if this is properly documented, and fix if it isn't.

The ResultSpec impl has an inner class, ToF_Languages.  When comparing 2 result specificaitons for equal in test cases, these are compared.  But they are missing an equals (and hashCode) methods.  So the test case fails to say they're equal unless they're identical.  But cloning happens a lot in the way Result specs are used, and in this test, they may be equal (I think) but not ==.Solution: Add proper equals and hashCode to this inner class.

This is not the case (at least in the ones I examined) - for instance, non of these were being used as a synch. lock.  Replacing with valueOf allows Java to cache and reuse frequent values, so reduces garbage collections.

texts:CPC stats returned from aggregates are invalid
The CPC stats for a delegate need to be accumulated by the client aggregate.Currently delegate stats are simply those returned by a CPC call to thedelegate. The problem with the current approach is that the delegate may be ashared service and the stats returned have very little or nothing to do with theprocess calls made to that delegate.Also, add new statistics for each delegate: biggest request time and biggestserialization time. These should also have mbeans.

texts:Input CAS is returned back to the client while subordinate CASes are still in play in the aggregate
When an input CAS is returned from a Cas Multiplier, an Aggregate immediately returns it back to the client with no check if the subordinate CASes (those produced from the input CAS) are still in "in-play" in other delegates. Upon receiving the input CAS reply, the client assumes success and sends a CPC. Meanwhile, the CASes still in-play may cause Exceptions and termination of the aggregate. The CPC sent to the service may never be replied to leading to a hang.

It is convenient to keep multiple POMs in one project, in separate directories.   An example of this is in the uimaj project, which has the overall super-pom for the uimaj project, but also has in a directory the super pom for the eclipse plugins, which serves to factor out the common parts of the plugins.  Another example is the sandbox poms - there is one overall pom for those projects, but as different things get collected together into packages, they may have poms in a subdirectory of another project.For POMs like this, the copying of the license notices, etc. needs to be skipped (it's already done at the higher level POM for the project), or if it is not skipped, the logic to locate the source is different (you have to go up 2 dir levels, relative - path - wise).

texts:maven build - Eclipse plugin build improvements
The current Eclipse plugins have complex maven poms - simplify by factoring out common things to a common super pom for the eclipse plugins, which will, in turn, inherit from the uimaj super pom.  Put this new pom in the uimaj project - no need for another project just for this.  Add configuration info so the eclipse:eclipse plugin does the right class path setup even when it is run from the top level.  This will allow cd to the uimaj project, and running eclipse:eclipse there, and having it work, as well as working in individual project directories.For POMs which inherit from our project poms, replace the <groupId> with a comment saying it is inherited from the super pom, and replace the <version> with a comment saying it's inherited from the super pom.Make the eclipse plugin super pom have the right form of the version (the one with the "." instead of the "-" in front of the "incubator" token).

texts:Improve Signing artifacts for deployment, and update also website signing topic
The current page on our website concerning signing, http://incubator.apache.org/uima/distribution.html, says to use the script in uimaj-distr / ... / build / signRelease . xxx  to sign the release.  This runs gpg and uses that to generate the md5 and sha1 hashes, which are in the wrong format (per discussion the incubator general mailing list).  Remove this signing script (because signing is now done from maven), and update our signing page to indicate how signing is now done.The uimaj-distr / ... /build/extractAndBuild script, if passed the -deploy switch, will turn on the gpg signing phase; this is configured in the uimaj pom.  This will do a gpg signing of the artifacts for all things that are built as part of the packaging phase for all "child" poms.  It's unclear how the md5 and sha1 checksums are generated for the deploy to maven repositories.  Inspecting the current repo at http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-incubating-repository/org/apache/uima/ shows md5 and sha1 checksums being applied to the gpg signatures, which is incorrect.  Fix / automate this process, to occur as part of the maven lifecycle when signing is asked for.  Make this work also for the Eclipse update site.

texts:Vinci Services have getMetaData timeout problems when there are a large number of clients
When I have a large number of clients I am experiencing timeouts in the getMetadata call.  There's currently no way to configure this timeout - in issue UIMA-33, we made the client descriptor's <timeout> element apply only to the process call, so getMetadata defaults to a 1 minute timeout.  With a small number of clients this is OK, but the Vinci service has a default thread pool of size 20 (also not configurable through the UIMA descriptor), so if you have more clients than this then this pool may get filled up with process requests forcing a getMetadata call to wait much longer.  Probably both of these settings should be configurable.

texts:eclipse plugins build broken - the messages resources are not found
Subsequent to the refactoring of the resources into uimaj/eclipse-plugin-superPom, running eclipse:eclipse is no longer putting the src/main/resources things into the class path.This is likely due to the resources not being merged with the maven overall superpom, anymore; that pom (see http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Super_POM ) contains    <resources>      <resource>        <directory>src/main/resources</directory>      </resource>    </resources>but when the eclipse-plugin-superPom had a similar <resources> element, it was (erroneously) presumed that its resources would be merged with the super pom.  The fix is to just put this in explicitly.

texts:Type System Merging does not work consistently when a type is declared twice with different supertypes
When type system merging is done, if the same type is declared twice with different supertypes, then the result depends on the order in which the types are declared.For example, given the type system descriptors:TS1.xml:<typeSystemDescription xmlns="http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier"><types><typeDescription><name>Sub</name><description>Example type.</description><supertypeName>uima.tcas.Annotation</supertypeName></typeDescription></types></typeSystemDescription>TS2.xml:<typeSystemDescription xmlns="http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier"><types><typeDescription><name>Sub</name><description>Example type.</description><supertypeName>Super</supertypeName></typeDescription><typeDescription><name>Super</name><description>Example type.</description><supertypeName>uima.tcas.Annotation</supertypeName></typeDescription></types></typeSystemDescription>If you merge them in the order TS1.xml, TS2.xml it will fail with the error message:  "The Type Sub is declared twice, with incompatible supertypes Super and uima.tcas.Annotation".  But if you merge them in the order TS2.xml, TS1.xml it will succeed!The intended behavior is that the merge should succeed and the resulting supertype should be "Super" (the lower of the two declared supertypes in the type hierarchy).  It is only supposed to fail if the different declared supertypes are not in the same inheritance chain (neither inherits from the other).  But that code is broken in the case where the two subtype declarations are processed before the supertype declarations.

texts:Incorrect support for process CAS error threshold count and threshold window
The thresholdAction should be taken when the number of CAS errors reaches the thresholdCount value within the last thresholdWindow CASes.  A thresholdWindow of 0 means an infinite window, so the action is taken when the total number of errors reaches the thresholdCount.  A thresholdCount of 0 means an infinite limit, errors are ignored.  A thresholdCount of 1 means that the first error triggers the action, hence the action must be taken when the threshold is REACHED, not exceeded as stated in the current docs.  (Although thresholds usually apply when exceeded, making the thresholdCount be the number permitted would require using a value such as -1 for no threshold, in contrast to our use of 0 to mean no timeout and no window)It should be an error to specify a (non-zero) thresholdWindow that is smaller than the thresholdCount ... an impossible situation.Note that if thresholdCount = 1 the thresholdWindow value is irrelevant, and if thresholdCount = thresholdWindow the action is taken when that many consecutive errors occur.

(Suggest we do this after 2.2.2 release)  The current Eclipse update site has one ant build script in the update-site project which builds the features and the update site.

The Eclipse Update site will have multiple features - some from sandbox projects - which could be on a different build / version schedule, and this change will support that.  After the change, the update site will only build the update site itself, copying any updated (new version) feature jars into its own project (where they will be stored in SVN and used for subsequent builds - because the update site will hold previous released "versions" of the features.

Our approach to the framework classpath is to (a) strip version info from our Jar names, and (b) have a setUimaClassPath script that adds lots of these (unversioned) jars to the classpath.Other systems use a different approach - usually putting all the jars that should be in the classpath into a directory, and then having a small wrapper jar (with an unversioned name) that adds all the jars it finds in this dir to the classpath.  (See for instance, ActiveMQ startup, or the way things like Tomcat work).    Change UIMA to use this approach.   (Not for 2.2.2, but for following release, perhaps).

The legal wiki seems to be converging to a concensus around having LICENSE and NOTICE files at the "root" of projects in SVN (underneath "trunk").  There was a lot of discussion about this from our previous release attempt.There are multiple kinds of LICENSE and NOTICE files - those for our "source" distributions (which are pretty simple), and those for our binary ones (which, because these sometimes include other projects, have more complex versions - see http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/uima/sandbox/trunk/uima-as/uima-as-distr/src/main/readme for instance).To conform to this emerging Apache convention, put the "source" style of licenses beneath the "trunk" directory in our SVN (we have at least 2 of these - one for the main branch, and one for the sandbox.)   Also put at top level (the level containing the projects) in uima-as - there is a "collection" directory for all the uima-as projects.

texts:Model files are contained twice in pear file
When building the tagger pear, the model files get included twice: once in the jar file, and once in the resources folder.  We don't really want the model files in the jar, anyway.  So fix the pom not to include the resources folder as a build resource.  The downside is that then the resources folder is no longer part of the classpath in the tagger eclipse project, meaning that it needs to be added manually when debugging the source.  However, that seems the only reasonable solution.

When UIMA AS client process() method finishes sending all CASes it calls collectionProcessComplete() which blocks on a CPC monitor until all CASes  are returned from the AS Service.

Also, add a test case to test the scenario.Hold for later release

texts:[UIMA eclipse plugins] Possible WRONG wiring of imported packages for UIMA Eclipse plugins
Problem:----------The current UIMA Eclipse plugins (runtime, CDE, etc.) use "Imported Packages" for declaring dependencies instead of "Required Plug-ins". This declaration is automatically generated by Maven (I think ?) and gives more fine grained controls on what to depend on.But, there are some side-effects from this approach which may cause the problems. The imported packages may wired to the correct packages from the "wrong" plugins.If there are, for example, two bundles (plug-ins) A and B export the "same" package name and B is resolved before A, OSGi will pick B bundle for wiring.This wrong wiring issue is happen when I tested CDE and DDE with Eclipse 3.2 in Linux Redhat 5 (Note that the problem can be happen with any Eclipse and platform). The following describes this particular case.CDE uses an Xml editor for source editing and this Xml editor requires a class called:          "org.eclipse.jface.text.source.SourceViewerConfiguration" from "org.eclipse.jface.text" pluginInside Eclipse installation, there is another plugin called "org.eclipse.text" that also exports this "org.eclipse.jface.text.source" which doesn't have the class  "SourceViewerConfiguration".When Eclipse runs, the "org.eclipse.text" plugin is resolved before the "org.eclipse.jface.text" plugin which causes CDE to be wired to the "org.eclipse.text" plugin. The expectation is to wire CDE to "org.eclipse.jface.text.source".Possible Resolution:------------------------One possible resolution is posted by Marshall in response to the thread in uima-dev:           &#91;UIMA eclipse plugins&#93; Possible WRONG wiring between UIMA Eclipse pluginsThe following is the quote:On Fri, Mar 14, 2008 at 4:58 PM, Marshall Schor <msa@schor.com> wrote:    OSGi does provide a mechanism to have the import-package include    specifying which bundle it should come from.  See section 3.6.8    "Provider Selection" in the r4.core.pdf doc for OSGi for details.    The POMs we use don't generate this though.  Do you see that allowing    multiple bundles to export the same package name, and then having our    configuration be more explicit about which bundle to wire to, is (or may    be) a design requirement?

texts:Eclipse split packages not handled well - causing plugin ClassNotFound failures
Some eclipse packages are split across multiple bundles.  The maven-bundle-plugin, by default, will put in a package import, which could get connected to only one of the bundles.  If that bundle doesn't have the class, you get a classnotfound exception.  Which bundle gets wired is arbitrary - often differing based on platform, build, etc.The fix is to identify all the split packages in Eclipse (these can be found by opening the Eclipse HELP and searching using the keywords ( split packages map )).  Then for each split package, add a Require-Bundle for each bundle that has some of the classes for that package.Add the Require-Package directive to the affected POMs to make these stable against possibly wrong wiring.

texts:Document Analyzer not showing PersonTitle when running with xml tagged source
Running the document analyzer with an input source of xml docs, and specifying the xml tag (of TEXT) causes the personTitle annotator to not show results.  This is traced to it being given a language of x-unspecified, even though the collection reader used set the document language to "en".  This is traced to the insertion of the xmldetagger into the aggregate, which passed a cas view of "plain text" to the personTitle annotator.  That component did not copy the language specifier from the input cas view.  In fact, the input cas view was "xmlDocument" - and that view also didn't have the language.  The collection reader put the language only into the "_InitialView".  Fix by having the XmlDetagger copy the initial view's language into the resulting plain text view it creates for downstream annotators to work on.Note that there are two copies of this class - fix both of them (One in tools, other in examples).

The following is an example settings that can be used when the top-level AE is implemented in C++:      <custom name="run_top_level_CPP_service_as_separate_process"/>      <environmentVariables>        <environmentVariable name="Path">C:\Program files/apache-uima/uimacpp/bin</environmentVariable>        <environmentVariable name="LD_LIBRARY_PATH">C:\Program Files/apache-uima/uimacpp/bin</environmentVariable>        <environmentVariable name="UIMACPP_DATAPATH">C:/mydata</environmentVariable>      </environmentVariables>

texts:Performance bug: CAS heap reset wasteful use of Arrays.fill()
CAS heap is filled with 0s on reset.  Currently, the whole heap is filled, instead of just the portion that was used.  This makes a huge difference for small documents.

When CVD is called with command line parameters, it attempts to initialize the GUI while executing tasks like loading text at the same time.  Those tasks manipulate the GUI, which may lead to deadlock.

texts:CDE incorrect tooltip for configuration parameter value field
The tooltip that's displayed when you hover over the "Value" field on the Configuration Parameter Settings page always says "Use the combo pulldown to select either true or false", even for non-boolean parameter types.Example: Open PersonTitleAnnotator.xml in the CDE, go to the Parameter Settings page, and select the "Containing Annotation Type" parameter from the list at the left.  Hover the mouse over the "Value" field at the top right.

The various docbook docs in the sandbox need to adopt the fix used inother uima books to avoid overflowing the footer on even pages (minor).I think adding this to the src/styles/top/pdf.xsl might do the trick:   <!-- width specifications: inside, center, outside -->   <!-- OVERRIDE:  inside is large to accommodate large version stringswithout overflowing -->   <xsl:param name="footer.column.widths">6 8 1</xsl:param>

texts:Add Logger.getLevel()
org.apache.uima.util.Logger should expose a .getLevel() method to match the existing .setLevel() method. This is needed, for example, by unit tests that test exceptions and want to temporarily suppress logging messages. In such situations, you want to get the original logging level, set the level to Level.OFF, and then later restore the original logging level. Currently, to get the original logging level, you have to write code like:    if (UIMAFramework.getLogger().isLoggable(Level.ALL)) {       return Level.ALL;    } else if (UIMAFramework.getLogger().isLoggable(Level.FINEST)) {       return Level.FINEST;    } ...Nasty! Adding .getLevel() shouldn't be too difficult &#8211; both org.apache.log4j.Logger and java.util.logging.Logger already have .getLevel() methods, so these just need appropriately wrapped.

texts:[uima-as] dd2spring doesn&#39;t properly handle urls in import by location which are absolute
UIMA Descriptors have <import> statements.  One variety of these is import by location.  The location can be relative or absolute; if relative, it is relative to the location of the file having the <import> statement. dd2spring handles this by keeping track of the importing file's file path, and (for relative urls) using that as the "base" to be relative from.  It has a heuristic test for determining if a path is absolute: it looks for a path that starts with a "/" or something like "c:/"  The CDE, when you import something outside the Eclipse workspace, uses the URL format "file:/c:/xxxx/etc"  This is an "absolute" location, but the dd2spring code's test for this fails.

The list of known problems in the shipped README is rather brief, and is soon out-of-date.  It would be nice to have a page on the website listing known problems and any work-arounds.
